00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
We've seen how an object becomes an entity and how it's mapped to a table,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.334
but entities can be related to

00:00:07.334 --> 00:00:11.759
other entities just like tables can be related to each other.

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.050
Let's look at our Orders and OrderItems entities.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.190
An order can contain many order items.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.995
In modeling terminology, order has a one-to-many relation with OrderItem.

00:00:25.995 --> 00:00:30.705
Let's see how we can map this relationship in JPA.

00:00:30.704 --> 00:00:35.849
Here, we have two entities Book and Author,

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.820
the relation between a book and an author can be described as

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.454
an author can write a book and a book can be returned by several authors.

00:00:45.454 --> 00:00:49.024
This is called a many-to-many relationship.

00:00:49.024 --> 00:00:52.174
In order to map a many-to-many relationship,

00:00:52.174 --> 00:00:57.089
we have to use an additional table called the mapping table or a join table.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.740
Book_Author is the mapping table here and it

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.915
contains the primary keys of both Book and author tables.

00:01:05.915 --> 00:01:09.385
In JPA, here's how we would map this,

00:01:09.385 --> 00:01:14.689
we have the entity book here with the usual annotations and we also

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:20.265
have the entity author with the usual annotations that are needed for an entity.

00:01:20.265 --> 00:01:25.420
In Book we have a list of authors.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.620
This list is annotated with the many-to-many annotation this tells

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:36.814
JPA that there is a many-to-many relationship between Book and Author.

00:01:36.814 --> 00:01:43.789
Now it needs to know about the join table and the corresponding foreign keys.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.170
The join table annotation here specifies the name of

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.790
the join table and the foreign key column for

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.300
this entity book which is BookId and

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:04.719
also the inverse joint column which is the foreign key for the Author table.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.569
If you look in the Author entity it is also mapped with

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.719
a many-to-many relationship but it's simply

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:19.009
states the mapping is done on the book entity side,

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:22.939
so it doesn't have to specify the relationship again.

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:26.719
This is how you map a many-to-many relationship.

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:30.109
There is one more type of relationship called

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.880
a one-to-one relationship which is discussed in the following section.
