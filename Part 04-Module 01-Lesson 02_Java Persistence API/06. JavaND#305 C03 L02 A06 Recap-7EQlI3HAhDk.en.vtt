00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.355
Nice job on completing Lesson 2.

00:00:02.355 --> 00:00:08.335
This lesson concludes our discussion of using relational databases with Java.

00:00:08.335 --> 00:00:12.135
Let's recap what we have learned so far.

00:00:12.134 --> 00:00:17.370
First, you did some basic CRUD operations using JPA.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.760
Then you learned about the entity lifecycle.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.640
Next, you flexed your brain muscles by writing some JPQL queries.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.039
Then, you used Spring Data JPA to reduce boilerplate code,

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:37.780
and finally, you wrote tests using Spring Boot and H2.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:47.539
JDBC, JPA, and Spring Data JPA each add a layer of abstraction on top of each other.

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.839
It is important to understand the fundamentals of

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.220
database access to effectively use the abstractions on top of it.

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.739
Keep in mind that JPA is not a silver bullet for every database problem,

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:07.100
and there are polarizing opinions for and against using an object relational framework.

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:11.569
As with every decision in software engineering, there are trade-offs.

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:14.869
As an engineer, it's up to you to consider

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.234
your circumstances and see if JPA would work for you.

00:01:19.234 --> 00:01:21.114
In the next lesson,

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:25.909
we'll begin our discussion of non-relational databases.

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.984
No tables, no schema.

00:01:28.984 --> 00:01:30.769
Sound interesting?

00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:33.299
See you in the next lesson.
