Hey, what are you up to?

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.369
I'm just trying to roll a Yahtzee.

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:11.724
What's a Yahtzee?

00:00:11.724 --> 00:00:14.154
Well, Yahtzee is this game where you roll these dice,

00:00:14.154 --> 00:00:16.899
five dice, and you try to get them all to match.

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:19.489
Okay, so like if I rolled all sixes.

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:21.159
Well, not necessarily sixes.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.059
As long as they all match a single number, then that's a Yahtzee.

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:26.229
Okay, but why?

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.030
I'm just trying to count how many times

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.010
I actually need to roll the dice to get a Yahtzee.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.510
And I'm also waiting for my computer to reboot.

00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:35.460
Okay, well, I can help you out.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.990
Thanks.

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.954
This is taking forever.

00:00:51.954 --> 00:00:53.475
I know, right?

00:00:53.475 --> 00:00:57.274
The odds are actually one to 1,296.

00:00:57.274 --> 00:00:59.699
So, mathematically speaking, we probably need to

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.250
keep rolling for like a thousand times to get a Yahtzee.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.814
That's a lot. We can always use a Java program to help us.

00:01:05.814 --> 00:01:09.450
I've actually just written a function that simulates rolling dice. You should use that.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.730
Yeah, that's a good idea.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.200
Why don't we use the while loops that we've just learned to simulate

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.969
this experiment and see how many rolls we actually need to get a Yahtzee?

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:18.019
Sounds like a plan.
