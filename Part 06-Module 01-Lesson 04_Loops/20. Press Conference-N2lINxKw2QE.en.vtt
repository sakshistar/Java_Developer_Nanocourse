00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.464
Imagine we're organizing this press conference.

00:00:03.464 --> 00:00:08.789
We've invited 10 news reporters and when it's time for them to ask the first question,

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:11.250
we want to randomly pick one of them.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.370
To make the random selection as fair as possible,

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:17.679
we decided to build a Java program to help us.

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:20.699
However, the first thing we need to decide is what

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.169
variable types should we use to keep track of the news outlet names.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.975
Strings come to mind,

00:00:26.975 --> 00:00:28.830
but there are 10 of them.

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:32.009
Are we going to declare 10 different strings?

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.254
Well, we can, but not only will our code get ugly and too long,

00:00:37.255 --> 00:00:41.219
but also, how are we going to randomly pick one of them?

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.289
Luckily, Java has this cool datatype called arrays.

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.079
Let's have a look how they work.
