00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.559
Now, can you write a function that accepts an array of strings as an argument and

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:09.335
searches in that array to find the longest string inside it?

00:00:09.335 --> 00:00:11.774
Your function should look something like this,

00:00:11.773 --> 00:00:15.809
public String findLongestName and then it

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.804
accepts a parameter which is an array of strings called names.

00:00:20.804 --> 00:00:23.519
Inside your function, the first thing you want to

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.719
do is get the size of your array or the length of your array,

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:30.484
so that you can use this for your loop condition.

00:00:30.484 --> 00:00:36.719
And then you want to create a loop that visits every single cell in this array and

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.119
compares the length of the string inside

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:44.004
that cell to the longest length that we've found so far.

00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:49.469
Remember to initialize the longest string to the very first item in the array as well.

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.000
For example, if the names array was something like this,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.820
then when you calculate the size of the array,

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.325
you should get 10.

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:06.250
You should initialize your longest name string variable to the very first one,

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.620
and then you should create a loop that visits every cell and

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.484
compares the length of each of those strings to the longest one that you have.

00:01:15.484 --> 00:01:18.599
If it is longer, then you update it to the new line.

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:20.579
By the end of the function,

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.379
if that was the input,

00:01:22.379 --> 00:01:25.724
you should get this name as your output.

00:01:25.724 --> 00:01:28.419
Remember that, to get the length of a string,

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.780
you use the.length function,

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.332
whatever string that is,

00:01:32.332 --> 00:01:35.000
which can also be a cell in the array.
