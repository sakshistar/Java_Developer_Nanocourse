00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.275
Okay. So, let's think about what we need to change to make this simulate

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:08.995
a full yahtzee rolling system with five dice instead of just three.

00:00:08.994 --> 00:00:11.741
Well, first, we need to declare those two variables,

00:00:11.742 --> 00:00:13.395
dice four and dice five,

00:00:13.394 --> 00:00:16.919
and we set them by calling the function rollDice.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.415
So now, we call this function rollDice five times simulating five different dice.

00:00:22.414 --> 00:00:24.480
And again, inside the while loop,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.440
we call them five times updating the variables dice four and dice five as well.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.500
Every time we roll all five dice,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.588
we update our count variable by one,

00:00:33.588 --> 00:00:38.004
because it means one single roll for all the five dice.

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:41.795
And lastly, we need to update our while loop condition here.

00:00:41.795 --> 00:00:44.730
So instead of just checking if dice one is the same as dice

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:47.554
two and dice two is the same as dice three,

00:00:47.554 --> 00:00:50.250
we also check that dice three is the same as dice

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.054
four and dice four is the same as dice five.

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:59.619
All that is surrounded by these parentheses that have a not signed before it,

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:04.953
which means the while would continue to loop as long as this is not true,

00:01:04.953 --> 00:01:08.890
which means as long as the five dice are not a match.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.980
Notice that I didn't have to say explicitly that dice

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.655
five is the same as dice two because that is implicit.

00:01:15.655 --> 00:01:18.579
If that condition happens and

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:22.614
the condition happens and that condition happens and that condition happens,

00:01:22.614 --> 00:01:27.579
that implicitly saying that all five dice are a match.

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:29.644
Also, on a small side note,

00:01:29.644 --> 00:01:33.865
notice how I had this written in two lines instead of just one.

00:01:33.864 --> 00:01:36.530
This is just to make it easier to read.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.739
Usually, it's okay to put new lines in

00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:41.259
the middle of commands in Java as long as it doesn't

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.719
break the command and it's generally used to make it easier to read, not harder.

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:52.069
So for now, don't worry about if you have to write long commands in one single line.

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:53.769
But as a side note,

00:01:53.769 --> 00:01:56.000
you can do something like this.
