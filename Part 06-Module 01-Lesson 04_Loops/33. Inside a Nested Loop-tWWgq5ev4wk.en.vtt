00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.075
The correct answer is, 9 times.

00:00:03.075 --> 00:00:05.640
The idea is that we're repeating something three

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:08.894
times and repeating this whole thing three times,

00:00:08.894 --> 00:00:11.549
which ends up being three times three,

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.135
giving us nine times.

00:00:13.134 --> 00:00:18.070
But let's see this in more detail and trace this program step by step as well.
