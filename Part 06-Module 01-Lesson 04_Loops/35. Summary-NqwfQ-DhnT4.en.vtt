00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.734
Congratulations. That was it.

00:00:02.734 --> 00:00:04.969
You've just completed your first Java course,

00:00:04.969 --> 00:00:06.710
in which you have learned all the basics you

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.969
need so that you can write your own Java programs.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.040
You've learned about decision making functions and loops and these are

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.309
all tools you can use to program a computer to solve lots of different problems for you.

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:22.219
Like using loops to repeat instructions many millions of times or using

00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:24.649
arrays to simulate a game or even program

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:27.945
the computer to think about the best move to make in a game.

00:00:27.945 --> 00:00:30.155
There's still a lot more that you can learn in Java,

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:32.689
most of which we'll be covering in the next courses,

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.359
like object-oriented programming and how to use

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:38.854
files to store and retrieve data and a lot more.

00:00:38.854 --> 00:00:41.059
For now, it's time to set up your own computer to

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.965
create and run Java programs all from scratch.

00:00:43.965 --> 00:00:47.470
I'll walk through how to download and install everything you need.

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:51.829
And remember that tic tac toe game that we did in lesson one, well,

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.884
once you're up and running with your computer,

00:00:53.884 --> 00:00:56.015
you should download our starter code for the game

00:00:56.015 --> 00:00:58.655
and start working on completing the code for us.

00:00:58.655 --> 00:01:02.325
You will find all the instructions you need to complete and submit this project.

00:01:02.325 --> 00:01:04.005
And if you have any questions,

00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:06.189
we're always here to help. Good luck.
