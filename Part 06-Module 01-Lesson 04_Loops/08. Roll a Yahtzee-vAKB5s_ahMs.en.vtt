00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
So far, we've managed to count how many roles we need to get a match using three dice.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.699
Can you modify the code to roll five dice instead of

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:13.064
three and count how many rolls we need to get those five dice to match,

00:00:13.064 --> 00:00:15.664
or other words, a yahtzee?

00:00:15.664 --> 00:00:19.859
Remember, you will need to declare two more dice here.

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.184
And also remember to re-roll them inside your loop.

00:00:23.184 --> 00:00:25.589
And finally, remember that you need to change

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:30.000
the while loop condition to handle all five dice, not just three.
