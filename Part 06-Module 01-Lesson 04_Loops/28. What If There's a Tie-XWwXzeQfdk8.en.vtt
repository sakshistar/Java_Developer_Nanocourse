00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
Great. So we've seen how to implement

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:08.314
the function findLongestName to find the longest string in array of strings.

00:00:08.314 --> 00:00:13.699
Have you wondered what if there are two strings in that array that have the same length?

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:16.554
For example, have a look at this array.

00:00:16.554 --> 00:00:21.140
These two names here are both eight characters long.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.227
Have a look at this implementation of the function here,

00:00:25.227 --> 00:00:33.079
trace it using this example and tell me which one of those options you think is correct.

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.149
Would this function return Kimberli as the longest name?

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.195
Would it return Apolonia as the longest name?

00:00:40.195 --> 00:00:43.369
Would it return both of them or none of them?
