00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.238
So the correct answer is while(len &lt; 101).

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:08.625
The idea is to repeat this loop

00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:13.320
for as long as len is still not equal to it's correct length.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.060
So as long as it's still smaller than 101, we add another zero.

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:21.134
If we actually added an equal sign here so that

00:00:21.135 --> 00:00:25.665
the condition is while(len &lt; or equal to 101),

00:00:25.664 --> 00:00:27.309
that would end up having an extra zero,

00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:32.820
because it would still step into the loop and add that extra digit.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.500
If you're still not convinced,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.960
let's try to trace the last few steps in

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.804
that loop and see what's actually happening behind the scenes.

00:00:40.804 --> 00:00:45.755
So on our string googol has 97 zeroes in it.

00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:48.940
Our len variable would get updated to 98,

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:51.875
because that's 1 followed by 97 zeroes,

00:00:51.875 --> 00:00:54.024
so that's 98 characters.

00:00:54.024 --> 00:00:56.964
But still, 98 is less than 101,

00:00:56.965 --> 00:01:00.720
making our while conditions still true.

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.329
So we step in again, add another zero,

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.447
so we have 98 zeroes so far,

00:01:05.447 --> 00:01:07.012
and our length is 99.

00:01:07.012 --> 00:01:11.540
99 is still less than 101, so that's true.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.756
Because it's true, we step in again and we add another zero to it,

00:01:15.756 --> 00:01:18.700
making it one followed by 99 zeroes,

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.310
and its length is 100.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.753
We finished our loop, we go back to our comparison,

00:01:24.753 --> 00:01:27.594
and 100 is less than 101 so it's true.

00:01:27.594 --> 00:01:29.641
Now, because it's true,

00:01:29.641 --> 00:01:31.759
we step in, we add this extra zero,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.540
so we finally have our googol string having 100 zeroes following the one.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.175
The next step is that we update our len variable,

00:01:39.174 --> 00:01:40.414
which makes it 101,

00:01:40.415 --> 00:01:43.960
and then we reach our end of the loop.

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:47.594
We go back up, and because now len is 101,

00:01:47.594 --> 00:01:50.325
it's no longer less than 101,

00:01:50.325 --> 00:01:53.195
which means this condition is actually false.

00:01:53.194 --> 00:02:00.000
So, we exit the loop with our string having exactly 100 zeroes following that one.
