00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
Just like nested if conditions,

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.464
nested loops means we have a loop inside another loop.

00:00:06.464 --> 00:00:08.929
Say for example, we have this loop here,

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:11.150
using the loop counter i that starts from

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.480
zero and counts as long as i is less than three.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.210
This means, whatever code we write inside this code block

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.894
here is going to be repeated exactly three times.

00:00:20.894 --> 00:00:24.289
Now, say we place another loop inside here,

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.509
using the loop counter j, for example,

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.290
that also starts from zero and counts as long as j is less than three,

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.710
which means whatever I type inside there would also get repeated three times itself.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.820
So, if we place a statement like this that just prints out this message, "Hi!"

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.299
How many times do you think this message would get printed?
