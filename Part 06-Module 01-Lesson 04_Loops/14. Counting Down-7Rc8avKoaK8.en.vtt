00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.964
So the correct solution is i greater than or equal to one.

00:00:04.964 --> 00:00:07.859
The reason is because we want this loop to keep going

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.290
for as long as i is still greater than or equal to one.

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:17.060
Remember that i now starts by three and it's decrementing one at a time.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.410
So for our loop to continue looping,

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.533
we need our loop condition to say that as long as i is greater than or equal to one.

00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.705
Because it starts at three,

00:00:26.705 --> 00:00:29.117
three is greater than or equal to one,

00:00:29.117 --> 00:00:32.455
so we'll print out three, will get decremented.

00:00:32.456 --> 00:00:34.764
Two is still greater than or equal to one,

00:00:34.764 --> 00:00:38.250
so we'll print out two and then it will get decremented.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.454
And one is still greater than or equal to one,

00:00:40.454 --> 00:00:42.480
so we'll print out one and then it will get

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:46.460
decremented and that means it will end up as zero.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.250
So our condition should be as long as i is greater than or equal to one, keep looping.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.000
Once it's no longer greater than or equal to one, we should stop.
