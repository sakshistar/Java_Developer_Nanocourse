00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
Now that we've managed to count the number of rolls,

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.734
we need to get two dice to match.

00:00:04.735 --> 00:00:07.800
Let's see what we need to do to add one more dice to

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.870
our problem and count the rolls we need to get three dice to match.

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:16.500
The first thing we need to do is declare this new variable integer dice3

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.535
here and set it to the return value of another roll dice call.

00:00:21.535 --> 00:00:23.789
We also need to do that inside a while loop.

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.859
When we re-roll our three dice,

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.539
we need to set dice3 to be equal to another call of the roll dice function.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.519
Now the last thing we need to do is change

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.930
this while loop condition over here to check that all three dice match,

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:38.750
instead of just two.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.789
Unfortunately, we can't do something like this where we say,

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:44.524
dice1 equal to dice2, equal to dice3.

00:00:44.524 --> 00:00:48.420
Any comparison in Java can only have two sides.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.460
Otherwise, Java would complain and throw

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.785
an error before it even allows you to run that code.

00:00:53.784 --> 00:00:56.399
However, we could use the logical operations that we've

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.890
learned in the previous lesson and break this check

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.379
here into multiple checks into one condition like these options here.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.329
They're all correct as far as Java is concerned,

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:11.965
but only one of them would actually make our loop work the way we want it to.

00:01:11.965 --> 00:01:15.890
So which one of them do you think this loop condition should be?

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.724
Remember that now, we want the loop to keep going

00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:21.979
as long as the three dice don't all match.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.120
Or in other words,

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.070
once all three dice match,

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:27.409
the loop should not go any longer.
