00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.984
Now, let's go back to our press conference.

00:00:02.984 --> 00:00:09.134
What we want to do is declare an array of strings that holds all our news outlet names.

00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:11.125
Something that looks like this.

00:00:11.125 --> 00:00:14.220
To do that, we type in string followed by

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.820
the square brackets which means that we're creating an array of strings.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.791
And then, the name of our array,

00:00:19.791 --> 00:00:21.667
in this case, newsOutlet,

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:24.984
followed by equals and the curly brackets and inside,

00:00:24.984 --> 00:00:27.545
we list all the values we want to store.

00:00:27.545 --> 00:00:32.460
Then, say we want to pick a certain value in the array,

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.390
we just go ahead and say system.out.print and then,

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.030
newsOutlet of index two.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.695
So, we're basically pointing to the string of index two.

00:00:43.695 --> 00:00:47.182
Zero, one, two which is going to be CNN,

00:00:47.182 --> 00:00:50.039
so the output is CNN.

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.810
And basically, you have chosen someone to ask the first question.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.635
But in our initial problem,

00:00:55.634 --> 00:00:57.419
we wanted this to be random.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.605
We wanted to randomly pick a news outlet.

00:01:00.604 --> 00:01:02.159
Well, if you remember,

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.894
we use Math.random earlier to generate random numbers for us.

00:01:06.894 --> 00:01:08.579
This might come in handy now.

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:10.474
Just like we did before,

00:01:10.474 --> 00:01:15.569
we will generate a random number and store it into the double variable, lucky.

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:19.289
So, we go double lucky equals Math.random.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.250
Remember that this generates a random number between zero and one.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.745
So we need to multiply that by 10 to get a fractional number between zero and 10,

00:01:28.745 --> 00:01:31.635
which is the number of news outlets that we have.

00:01:31.635 --> 00:01:34.890
Remember that lucky times equals 10 is just

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.420
multiplying lucky by 10 and updating itself with that new value.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.030
And then, we want to cast that variable into

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.365
an integer so that we don't get a fractional number anymore,

00:01:45.365 --> 00:01:49.219
but we get a whole integer number and that's between zero and nine.

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:52.500
The way we do casting is we just write the type that we

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.049
want to cast it to between brackets just before the variable name here.

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.579
And then we can store that in an integer called luckyIndex.

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.560
So now, we end up with this luckyIndex variable that is between zero and nine,

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.120
and it is an integer so we can access any particular part of the array.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.480
So the last thing we want to do is print out

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:15.679
the name of the news outlet who we randomly picked.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.099
So we go ahead and say system.out.print,

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.674
and then we say newsOutlet, square brackets, luckyIndex.

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:25.602
So based on the random number that was generated,

00:02:25.602 --> 00:02:28.920
this luckyIndex can be anything between zero and nine.

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:33.434
So we randomly pick one of those and displayed it in the print screen.

00:02:33.435 --> 00:02:36.504
Let's trace a few examples and see what's happening.

00:02:36.504 --> 00:02:42.990
Assume that Math.random generated a number that's equal to 0.433.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.025
The first thing we do is we multiply it by 10, making it 4.23,

00:02:47.025 --> 00:02:49.157
and then we cast it into an integer,

00:02:49.157 --> 00:02:52.735
throwing away the fractional part so that becomes just four.

00:02:52.735 --> 00:02:55.060
So our luckyIndex is four.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.569
So the last line just prints out news outlet of four.

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.259
And what is news out of four?

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:03.389
It's zero, one, two,

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.594
three, four, it's this string here, which is AP.

00:03:06.594 --> 00:03:10.349
If our random number that was generated was 0.987,

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:11.750
so that's in lucky,

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.310
we'll multiply that by 10, giving us 9.87.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.729
And then we cast that into an integer so we throw away

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:20.474
that fractional part giving us nine,

00:03:20.474 --> 00:03:24.659
and then we print out news outlet of nine,

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:27.305
which happens to be Aljazeera.

00:03:27.305 --> 00:03:31.980
The same happens for any value that is generated for a variable lucky because

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:36.469
we always multiply it by 10 and then cast it into an integer. So there we go.
