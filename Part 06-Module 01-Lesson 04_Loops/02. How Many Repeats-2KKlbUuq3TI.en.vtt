00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.019
The correct solution here is, we can't tell.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.469
The problem here, is we don't know how many beeps it will

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:11.669
take for someone to actually hit the snooze button and turn it off.

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:13.199
And for every beep,

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.929
we need to copy and paste this if block

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.789
here for as many times as it needs until someone hits the snooze button.

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.079
And because we don't know how many times it will be before someone hits the button,

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.000
we really don't know how many times we should repeat this.
