00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.609
Say we want to add smart windshield wipers to

00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:06.490
our self-driving car and have them activate when it's raining outside.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.669
Given the boolean variable isRaining,

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:11.870
which will be true when it rains and false when it isn't raining,

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:14.264
write an if statement that will print the sentence,

00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:16.734
windshield wipers on, when it is raining,

00:00:16.734 --> 00:00:19.000
and it will print out nothing otherwise.
