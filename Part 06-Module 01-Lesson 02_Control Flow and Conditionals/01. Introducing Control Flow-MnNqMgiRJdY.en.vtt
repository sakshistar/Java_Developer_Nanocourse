00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.310
Now that we've explored different variable types in Java,

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.685
and seeing how computers follow instructions like printing out a sentence,

00:00:06.685 --> 00:00:08.669
let's take this a step further.

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:13.259
What if I wanted to program a smart coffee maker that would make me my favorite espresso,

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.974
but would also give other people their favorite kind of coffee.

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:17.199
Whether that's a latte,

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.464
or espresso, or something else.

00:00:19.464 --> 00:00:22.390
Our program would have to know which person is asking for coffee,

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.719
and then follow a different set of instructions to get me an espresso,

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:27.669
and other people their favorite drink.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.210
In this lesson, we will talk about how to build programs that make decisions like

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.880
this and can follow different sets of instructions based on the information we give it.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.679
This is called control flow.

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:42.325
We use it to build programs together to do things like make a smart coffeemaker,

00:00:42.325 --> 00:00:44.845
automatically set museum admission prices,

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:47.304
create a restaurant rating system and more.

00:00:47.304 --> 00:00:49.299
And after, you'll have the tools you need to build

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:51.814
a program that follows any rules you specify.

00:00:51.814 --> 00:00:54.289
Let's start by learning how computers make decisions.
