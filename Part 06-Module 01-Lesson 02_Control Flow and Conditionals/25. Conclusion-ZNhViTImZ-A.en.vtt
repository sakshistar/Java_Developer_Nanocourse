00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.950
Now we've seen how to control the way computers make decisions by

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.550
giving them information from the outside world about data that can change,

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:09.634
like traffic lights, weather or pass

00:00:09.634 --> 00:00:13.199
codes and we can create programs that react to this data.

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:17.509
We use booleans to test whether data falls into conditions that are either true or

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.030
false and then use control flow to create

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.585
decision pathways to take with if and else statements.

00:00:23.585 --> 00:00:27.214
And decisions are important for so many applications.

00:00:27.214 --> 00:00:30.170
We've seen how it applies to self-driving cars and

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.500
automated behavior like setting museum admission prices.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.869
After learning about control flow you're well on

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:38.629
your way to making smart and efficient programs.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.460
Next we'll learn how to effectively group code

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.000
together with functions. Let's keep learning.
