00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.820
Here's the correct answer.

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:03.810
We need to write an if statement that uses

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.790
the boolean variable 'isRaining' as a test condition.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.355
So, it can test its value and check to see whether or not it's raining.

00:00:10.355 --> 00:00:12.269
Then if 'isRaining' is true,

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.184
we'll enter our if block of code and print out, "Windshield wipers on."

00:00:16.184 --> 00:00:17.820
But if, ''isRaining' is false,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.234
we'll skip over our block of code and nothing will print out.

00:00:21.234 --> 00:00:23.160
So this is our complete if statement.
