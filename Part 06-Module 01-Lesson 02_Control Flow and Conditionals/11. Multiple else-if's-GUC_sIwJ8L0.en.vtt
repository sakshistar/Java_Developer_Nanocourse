00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.139
I've written a program that accepts applications for a library card.

00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:07.889
Library cards give you access to a lot of books you might want to read.

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:09.150
And to apply for a card,

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.710
you need to show some form of identification.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.610
This program accepts a passport,

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:18.494
a birth certificate, or a driver's license as valid ID.

00:00:18.495 --> 00:00:23.670
And whether or not a person provides any of these is stored in these boolean variables,

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.720
passport, birthCertificate and driversLicense.

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:30.434
And these are true if that kind of ID is given.

00:00:30.434 --> 00:00:34.519
A person might provide multiple forms of ID or none at all.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.740
And this program will print out whether an ID is valid,

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.645
or if the ID is invalid,

00:00:39.645 --> 00:00:43.200
and then the application for a library card is denied.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.230
What will the output of this program be for the following boolean values?

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:50.669
Passport equals false, birth certificate equals true,

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.000
and driver's license equals true.
