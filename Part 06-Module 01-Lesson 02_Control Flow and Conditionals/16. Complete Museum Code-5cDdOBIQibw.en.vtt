00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.819
For checking if someone is greater than 60 years old,

00:00:02.819 --> 00:00:07.064
it's as simple as adding another age tag after the first as an else if.

00:00:07.064 --> 00:00:08.699
And our test condition should be,

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:11.279
if age is greater than 60.

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:14.820
This code works as an else if but would also work as just an

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.019
if since a person cannot be both less than 15 and greater than 60.

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.949
Then, our last test condition is to check if someone is

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.554
a student which we can check by saying, else if isStudent.

00:00:27.554 --> 00:00:29.519
Then, if isStudent is true,

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.039
we'll enter our discount block of code.

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:36.000
Now notice that we're offering the same discount for all three of these checks.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.515
In the name of concise simple code,

00:00:38.515 --> 00:00:41.590
wouldn't it be nice if we could reduce this repetition?

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.070
There is actually a way to do this by combining

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.179
these three checks into one bigger test condition which we'll get into next.
