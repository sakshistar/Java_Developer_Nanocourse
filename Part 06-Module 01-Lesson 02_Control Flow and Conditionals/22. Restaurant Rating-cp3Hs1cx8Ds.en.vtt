00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.199
Here's a program for

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:06.165
a restaurant rating system that rates a restaurant with a rating 0 through 5.

00:00:06.165 --> 00:00:08.669
Zero is the worst and five is the best.

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:13.900
It uses nested ifs to first check if a rating is a valid input between zero and five.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.425
Then in our nested if,

00:00:15.425 --> 00:00:17.760
if the rating is less than or equal to two,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.935
it prompts you for a reason for why you're leaving a low rating and after the nested if,

00:00:22.934 --> 00:00:25.404
it prints out "Thank you for your feedback."

00:00:25.405 --> 00:00:29.000
What will this code print out if our rating variable is equal to four?
