00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.075
Say we've written a switch statement that prints out the month,

00:00:03.075 --> 00:00:04.695
based on the number we give it.

00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:06.419
So, if month equals one,

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:08.640
our month string will equal January and we'll

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.290
print that out at the end of our switch statement.

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:12.329
If month equals two,

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.711
we'll print out February,

00:00:13.711 --> 00:00:15.820
three, March and so on.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.045
But this code only includes cases up to the number 11,

00:00:19.045 --> 00:00:20.222
the month of November,

00:00:20.222 --> 00:00:21.995
the code isn't finished.

00:00:21.995 --> 00:00:24.885
Complete this switch statement by writing the last case,

00:00:24.885 --> 00:00:28.620
case 12 to print out December and writing a default case,

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.664
so that for any month number not between 1 and 12,

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:33.543
say too large number like 37,

00:00:33.543 --> 00:00:36.059
this code will print out, Invalid month.
