00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.184
This program is for sorting trash and recycling items that are recyclable,

00:00:04.184 --> 00:00:07.214
like paper or empty plastic or glass bottles.

00:00:07.214 --> 00:00:10.125
For these items isRecyclable will be true.

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:13.769
But for now, we don't know what the value of isRecyclable will be.

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.515
We also weigh our recyclable items in ounces

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:20.030
and store that information in the variable double weight.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.240
And if we have a recyclable item, we'll print out this weight.

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:25.859
Looking at this code and variable declarations,

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.105
which of these three boundaries represents the scope of the variable weight?

00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:32.939
Choose either scope A, B, or C,

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:36.000
which go from the largest to the smallest scope boundaries.
