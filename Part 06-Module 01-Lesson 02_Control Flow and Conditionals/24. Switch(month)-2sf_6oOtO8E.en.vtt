00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.898
Here's the solution. For our last case, case 12,

00:00:03.898 --> 00:00:08.290
we write it just like any other case and set our month string to December.

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:10.244
Then for our default case,

00:00:10.244 --> 00:00:11.579
we just write default,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.134
a colon, and then set our monthString to equal Invalid month.

00:00:16.135 --> 00:00:21.030
And this handles any case where a month doesn't fall between the values 1 and 12.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.450
So this handles both of the cases we described before. Well done.
