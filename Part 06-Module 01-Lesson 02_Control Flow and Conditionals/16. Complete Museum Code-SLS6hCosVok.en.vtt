00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.889
Let's complete our checks to see who

00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:04.964
qualifies for a discounted ticket to this art museum.

00:00:04.964 --> 00:00:08.855
We already have the variable for our general ticket price set equal to

00:00:08.855 --> 00:00:12.450
10 and code for checking if a person's age is less than,

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.209
or equal to 15 years old.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.500
But we still need two more tests.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.144
Fill in the blanks in our code to check for two other discount cases,

00:00:20.144 --> 00:00:22.634
and apply the discount for these conditions.

00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:23.910
Our first should be,

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.304
if a person's age is greater than 60.

00:00:26.304 --> 00:00:27.894
Not exactly equal to 60,

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:29.509
but anything above that.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.080
And our second test should be,

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:32.969
if the person is a student or not.

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.710
And if any of these conditions are met,

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.310
we apply the discount price.
