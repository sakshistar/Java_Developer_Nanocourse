00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.875
For entrance to this museum,

00:00:01.875 --> 00:00:04.615
it would have been nice to have an automated discount.

00:00:04.615 --> 00:00:06.270
Let's build a program that calculates

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:09.474
the correct ticket price for entrance to this museum.

00:00:09.474 --> 00:00:14.024
The ticket price should generally be $10 per person but also include a discount,

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:16.894
so that it's only $5 in three cases.

00:00:16.894 --> 00:00:19.774
One, for young people aged 15 and under.

00:00:19.774 --> 00:00:22.879
Two, for older people aged greater than 60.

00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:25.605
And three, if you're a student of some sort like you,

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:27.495
then you also get the discount.

00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:30.175
So how can we build a program like this?

00:00:30.175 --> 00:00:34.045
First, let's keep track of our ticketPrice by declaring it as a variable,

00:00:34.045 --> 00:00:36.713
and we'll give it an initial general value of 10,

00:00:36.713 --> 00:00:40.649
which we can change to our discount price of five in our code in a bit.

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.589
Then, to tell if someone qualifies for a discount,

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.720
we'll also need variables that keep track of

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.539
someone's age and whether or not they're a student.

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.519
I've chosen to represent age as a whole number, as an int.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.635
And whether a person is a student or not can be either true or false.

00:00:56.634 --> 00:00:58.239
So that will be a boolean.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.679
So let's say we have access to the value of these two variables,

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:04.920
but we don't exactly know what their value will be.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.379
Now, let's consider our first discount condition,

00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:10.140
that someone is 15 years old or younger.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.915
We basically want to turn this into an if statement,

00:01:12.915 --> 00:01:16.960
where a test condition checks if age is less than or equal to 15.

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:19.679
And if that's true, we execute code to give this

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.335
person a discount and set our ticket price to $5.

00:01:23.334 --> 00:01:28.634
So to write our first test for ages 15 and under as a boolean comparison, we'd say,

00:01:28.635 --> 00:01:32.250
if age is less than or equal to 15,

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.010
then if this is true, inside our if,

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.515
we want to set the ticketPrice to our discount value of five.

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:39.855
And at the end of our code,

00:01:39.855 --> 00:01:43.280
I want to print out the value of ticketPrice for us to see.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.969
Now, if we run this code and the age variable is less than 15 say,

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:53.364
10 years old, we'll pass our if test condition and our ticketPrice will be set to five,

00:01:53.364 --> 00:01:55.189
then we'll print this value out.

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.620
But if our age is greater than 15 like 25,

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.480
we don't enter our if statement,

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.288
and our ticketPrice will remain

00:02:02.287 --> 00:02:06.194
our initial general value of 10 and that value we'll print out.

00:02:06.194 --> 00:02:08.264
Our other two discount conditions,

00:02:08.264 --> 00:02:11.759
we'll be checking if someone's age is greater than not greater than and

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:16.064
equal to 60 years old and if a person is a student.

00:02:16.064 --> 00:02:18.539
Let's complete those checks in the following.
