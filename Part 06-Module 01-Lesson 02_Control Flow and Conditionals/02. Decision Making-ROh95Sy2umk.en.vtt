00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.225
Most decisions we make are based on simple observations,

00:00:03.225 --> 00:00:06.025
like the sale price of shirts at a clothing store.

00:00:06.025 --> 00:00:10.185
If they're very expensive shirts we might only consider a big sale a good deal,

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:12.169
like 40 percent off or more.

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:15.179
In other cases, like if I just really like the shirts,

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.314
if the discount is 10 percent or greater that might suffice.

00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:20.640
When we make a decision like this we're acting on

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.594
some input information and checking if a condition,

00:00:23.594 --> 00:00:26.379
like a certain low price or discount level, is met.

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:29.449
That's similar to how computers make decisions as we'll see next.
