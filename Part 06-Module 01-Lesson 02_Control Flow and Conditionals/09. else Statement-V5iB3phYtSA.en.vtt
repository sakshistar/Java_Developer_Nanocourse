00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.174
So now for our self-driving car,

00:00:02.174 --> 00:00:04.625
we have a car that drives when it sees a green light

00:00:04.625 --> 00:00:07.740
but it doesn't do anything specific when it doesn't see a green light,

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.265
like when the light is yellow or red.

00:00:10.265 --> 00:00:13.350
And for safety, we want to tell it to stop whenever the,

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.529
isLightGreen condition is false.

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:19.634
And Java gives us an easy way to do this with an else statement.

00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:23.429
An else statement can only come after an if statement,

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.189
and it let's us provide an alternate set of instructions to

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.820
follow for when the if test condition is not met.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.789
Using these together is called an if/else statement

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:37.170
and it gives two possible decision pathways for our computer to take.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.150
Actually, the if/else statement is often compared to how humans make decisions.

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.494
Like in this case, I might describe my driving decision as

00:00:45.494 --> 00:00:49.349
if the light is green I'll drive otherwise, I'll stop.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.865
And in else statement,

00:00:50.865 --> 00:00:54.085
is the code equivalent of saying otherwise.

00:00:54.085 --> 00:00:57.804
Based on the value of our Boolean variable isLightGreen,,

00:00:57.804 --> 00:01:00.750
our computer will make a decision to execute code contained in

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.176
the if statement when isLightGreen is true or in the else statement,

00:01:05.176 --> 00:01:06.995
when isLightGreen is false.

00:01:06.995 --> 00:01:10.275
It will never execute both blocks of code.

00:01:10.275 --> 00:01:13.219
Let's see how to write an else statement.

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:15.129
Here's our else statement.

00:01:15.129 --> 00:01:18.060
Instead of having no code after our if statement,

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.150
we just write else after the end of the ifs closing

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.855
curly brace and then the code we want to execute in the else,

00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:27.329
will be surrounded by curly braces.

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:32.679
Notice that the else statement has no test condition associated with it like the if does.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.725
Now, if the light is not green,

00:01:34.724 --> 00:01:36.515
we want our car to stop driving.

00:01:36.515 --> 00:01:40.769
Let's print out that action stop in the else.

00:01:40.769 --> 00:01:44.450
Now let's try this code out with assigned Boolean values.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.335
If is light green is true,

00:01:46.334 --> 00:01:50.829
our if test condition will be satisfied and our code will print out “Drive!”.

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:52.304
Otherwise if it's false,

00:01:52.305 --> 00:01:54.630
this will fail or if test condition and go into

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:58.939
our else statement block of code instead and this will print out “Stop!”.

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.534
Again, only one of these blocks of code will be executed when you run this code.

00:02:03.534 --> 00:02:07.155
Either the code in the if or the code in the else.

00:02:07.155 --> 00:02:10.740
But I bet you're wondering, what if the traffic light is yellow or flashing?

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.070
We'll need more than just two decision pathways to take.

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.590
Next we'll see how to construct even more pathways.
