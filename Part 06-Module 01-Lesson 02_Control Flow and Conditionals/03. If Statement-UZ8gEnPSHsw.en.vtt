00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.264
The way computers make decisions is to something called an if statement.

00:00:04.264 --> 00:00:06.069
This isn't that different from the way humans make

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.380
decisions. Let me show you what I mean.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.810
For example, when I go on art store, I may think,

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.109
if marker is on sale for a certain amount, then I'll buy a lot of them.

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:15.939
But when I go outside, I'll think,

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:18.789
if it's cold outside, then I'll wear a jacket.

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.355
These are simple if statements I use to make decisions all the time.

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:24.196
I check if some condition is true,

00:00:24.196 --> 00:00:25.550
like if it's cold outside,

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.745
and if it is, then I perform some action like wearing a coat.

00:00:28.745 --> 00:00:31.815
In programming, the if statement is used the same way

00:00:31.815 --> 00:00:35.149
to test different conditions and execute code accordingly.

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.804
Let's translate our decision about whether to wear a coat or not into Java code.

00:00:39.804 --> 00:00:42.534
To make a decision about wearing a coat,

00:00:42.534 --> 00:00:44.699
we just need to know if it's cold outside.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.075
And if it is, we'll wear a coat.

00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:49.450
The Java code for making a decision about wearing

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.655
a coat is an if statement that looks like this.

00:00:52.655 --> 00:00:55.450
Let's look at our decision making code first.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.078
We have an if that starts our if statement,

00:00:58.078 --> 00:01:01.864
followed by the information our program needs to make a decision.

00:01:01.863 --> 00:01:04.239
This will tell us whether it's cold outside or not,

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.599
and it's inside the parentheses.

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:08.199
This variable value, isCold,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.945
is something called a test condition,

00:01:10.944 --> 00:01:14.849
because it's value varies to tell us if it is or isn't cold,

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:17.479
and we have to test it to determine it's value.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.895
And this test condition has to evaluate to either true or false,

00:01:21.894 --> 00:01:24.039
and what variable do we know that does that?

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.583
Booleans.

00:01:25.582 --> 00:01:28.075
Booleans can only have the value true or false,

00:01:28.075 --> 00:01:30.090
and are perfect for decision making.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.620
So let's say we have access to this boolean,

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.420
isCold, but we don't know whether it will be true or false.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.700
The next thing in our if statement is a block of

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.240
code which can be multiple lines of code and comments,

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:47.229
and this code will only execute if the test condition, isCold,

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.150
is true, and this whole block of code is surrounded by these curly braces.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.005
And that completes our if statement.

00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:58.719
Notice that the if statement does not end with a semi colon like other lines of code do.

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:01.655
It begins and ends with curly braces instead.

00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:06.257
And that's because a semi-colon tells our code that this is the end of a statement,

00:02:06.257 --> 00:02:08.634
but an if statement is more like a container

00:02:08.634 --> 00:02:11.709
that holds lines of code inside these braces.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.046
So let's say the value of isCold is true,

00:02:15.045 --> 00:02:16.900
then our test condition will be true,

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.164
and will enter our if statement block of code,

00:02:19.164 --> 00:02:22.120
and then our print output will be "It's cold, wear a coat!"

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.200
But if isCold is false,

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:28.134
our test condition won't be true and we'll skip over this block of code,

00:02:28.134 --> 00:02:30.284
and nothing will be printed out.

00:02:30.284 --> 00:02:32.479
Next, let's see how we can apply our knowledge about

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:35.389
if statements to program a simplified self-driving car.
