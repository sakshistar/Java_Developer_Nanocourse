00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
There are lots of decision-making scenarios that require more than two pathways to take.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.215
Like for our self-driving car,

00:00:07.214 --> 00:00:10.060
what if the traffic light it sees is yellow?

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.440
We might want to tell the car to perform some other action like slow down.

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:18.644
But right now, we only have the options to stop or to drive.

00:00:18.644 --> 00:00:24.000
So, how can we build off our if-else statement to include more than these two options?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.905
Well, that's where the else-if comes in.

00:00:25.905 --> 00:00:28.800
The else-if comes after an if but before

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.085
an else statement and it checks a different test condition than the one in our if.

00:00:34.085 --> 00:00:36.780
So instead of checking if the light is green,

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.524
our else-if can check if the light is yellow,

00:00:39.524 --> 00:00:42.600
and it provides another decision pathway

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.429
which is just an alternate set of instructions, like slow down.

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:51.859
And this will only execute if our previous if test condition is false.

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:53.799
So, when isLightGreen is false,

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:56.339
our code will go to our else-if.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.640
And if its test condition, isLightYellow, is true,

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.825
then we can print out Slow Down,

00:01:01.825 --> 00:01:05.969
and Slow Down becomes another decision pathway.

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:08.189
So, only if both of these light conditions are

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.409
false will our code go to our else and print out Stop.

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.094
Let's see what this looks like in our self-driving car Java code.

00:01:16.094 --> 00:01:18.495
Here's our code with our else-if.

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:20.910
The first thing we need to know for our else-if

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.325
test condition is if the traffic light is yellow.

00:01:24.325 --> 00:01:27.045
So let's say we have a new boolean variable,

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:30.799
isLightYellow, which will be either true or false.

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.625
And then we have our else-if,

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:35.549
after our if but before our else statement,

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.090
and this checks the test condition, isLightYellow.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.460
So if the light is yellow but not green,

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:44.804
we'll enter our else-if and print out Slow Down.

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:47.955
And now, we have three decision pathways we can take.

00:01:47.954 --> 00:01:51.149
One, if the light is green, this prints Drive.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.425
Two, otherwise, if the light is not green but it is yellow,

00:01:55.424 --> 00:01:57.364
this will print out Slow Down.

00:01:57.364 --> 00:02:00.189
And three, if none of those conditions are met,

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:02.534
this prints out Stop.

00:02:02.534 --> 00:02:04.114
So let's try this out.

00:02:04.114 --> 00:02:09.509
First, let's consider what happens if isLightGreen is true and isLightYellow is false.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.669
And in this case, the value of isLightYellow

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:14.974
won't matter and we'll see why that is in a moment.

00:02:14.974 --> 00:02:16.870
Now that we have these boolean values,

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.340
the computer will go through our decision-making code line by line.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.800
It first gets to our if statement and checks whether isLightGreen is true.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.185
It is true, so we'll enter our if block of code and print out Drive,

00:02:29.185 --> 00:02:30.944
and this will complete our code.

00:02:30.944 --> 00:02:32.549
That's all that will be printed.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.570
Our else-if and else statements will be skipped entirely.

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.919
The value of isLightYellow will never even be tested and that's

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:42.659
because once the computer executes

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.659
an if block of code like it did when it printed out Drive,

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:50.525
it will skip down to the very end curly brace of our last else or else-if.

00:02:50.525 --> 00:02:54.460
And for this code, that's at the very end of our program.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.599
Now, what if we switch these boolean values?

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.680
So, isLightGreen is false and isLightYellow is true.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.750
The computer will start again reading code from the top and first read our if statement.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.875
It checks the test condition whether isLightGreen is true and this time, it isn't.

00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:14.889
So, it will move on down to our next block, our else-if.

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:18.659
And our else-if checks if isLightYellow is true.

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:23.384
It is, so we'll enter our else-if block of code and print out Slow Down.

00:03:23.384 --> 00:03:26.340
Our else statement will be skipped again just like in

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.170
the last example and that's because once the computer executes an else-if block of code,

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:35.774
it will again skip down to the end curly brace of the last else or else-if.

00:03:35.775 --> 00:03:40.635
That means that for even longer series of checks with multiple else-if statements,

00:03:40.634 --> 00:03:44.669
only one of their enclosed blocks of code can be executed at a time,

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:48.780
the block that belongs to whichever test condition is met first.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.748
Only if both of these light conditions are false will

00:03:51.748 --> 00:03:55.549
our computer reach our else statement and print out Stop.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.385
So, if isLightGreen is false and isLightYellow is false,

00:03:59.384 --> 00:04:02.620
that's the only time that we reach our else statement.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.000
Let's see some more examples of how to use else-ifs for decision-making.
