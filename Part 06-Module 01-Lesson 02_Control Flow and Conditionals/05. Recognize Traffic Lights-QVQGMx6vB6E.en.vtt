00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660
Let's say we're programming a self-driving car and the first thing

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.455
we want it to be able to do is recognize a simple traffic light,

00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:11.310
and use control flow to start driving when it sees a green light.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.202
We first need to know whether the light is green or not.

00:00:14.202 --> 00:00:16.480
And if it is, then we want to drive.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.060
So let's translate this into Java code.

00:00:19.059 --> 00:00:21.384
We first need to know if the light is green,

00:00:21.385 --> 00:00:26.070
and we can store this information as a boolean variable which I'll call isLightGreen,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.510
and this will either be true or false.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.760
Then let's create our IF statement.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.245
We want a test condition to check if isLightGreen is true.

00:00:34.244 --> 00:00:36.750
So we'll say, if isLightGreen.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.000
And if this test condition is true,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.219
we'll enter whatever code is contained inside

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.769
the curly braces of our IF statement and we'll execute that code.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.245
And inside our IF statement,

00:00:46.244 --> 00:00:50.354
we'll just print out the action we want our car to take, which is to drive.

00:00:50.354 --> 00:00:52.334
If our test condition isn't met,

00:00:52.335 --> 00:00:54.274
if isLightGreen is false,

00:00:54.274 --> 00:00:58.905
Java will skip over our IF code and go to the end of this closing curly brace.

00:00:58.905 --> 00:01:01.054
And if there are more lines of code done here,

00:01:01.054 --> 00:01:03.744
it will continue reading lines of code from here.

00:01:03.744 --> 00:01:05.965
So this is our finished IF statement.

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:08.909
So if isLightGreen is true and we run this code,

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.719
we'll enter IF statement block of code and the print output will be “Drive!”.

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:16.170
If our test condition isLightGreen was false,

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.019
we won't print out anything.

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:22.034
It's also worth noting that we could add even more IF statements after this one,

00:01:22.034 --> 00:01:25.185
if we want to check and act on other test conditions.

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:27.740
Next, let's practice writing our own IF statements.
