00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.924
Say, you're at a clothing store, and shirts are on sale.

00:00:02.924 --> 00:00:05.809
How do you decide if the sale is a good deal or not?

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:08.535
Describe the criteria you look for in a sale,

00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:10.484
and your decision process.

00:00:10.484 --> 00:00:13.739
For example, if shirts are discounted 20 percent or more,

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.984
from their original price,

00:00:14.984 --> 00:00:16.814
then that might be a good deal.

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:21.000
Or, if you already have a lot of shirts then maybe no deal will interest you. And so on.
