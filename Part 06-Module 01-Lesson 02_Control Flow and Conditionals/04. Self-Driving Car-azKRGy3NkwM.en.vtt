00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.940
Right now, Google is in the process of building and testing self-driving cars.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.860
These cars are designed to safely navigate through

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.324
city streets without needing a human driver.

00:00:09.324 --> 00:00:10.969
But how do they do it?

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.350
The cars includes sensors that detect objects and information from all around the car,

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.269
and then software processes all of

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:20.960
this information to help the car make decisions about driving.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.525
There's a lot of programming involved to make these cars safe,

00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:25.500
and decision making is key.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.440
Let's see what we know about decision making,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.780
and write a program to help a car recognize,

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.060
and respond to traffic lights.
