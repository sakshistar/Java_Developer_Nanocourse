00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.009
Here are the correct values.

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:03.586
For our first expression,

00:00:03.587 --> 00:00:07.144
we're checking if x is less than or equal to 21.

00:00:07.144 --> 00:00:08.759
We know that x is 20,

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:12.390
and 20 is less than 21, so this will be true.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.175
For our next expression,

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:16.769
we're checking if two times two, is greater than eight.

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:22.045
Two times two is four which is less than eight so this is false.

00:00:22.045 --> 00:00:25.685
Next we're checking if five is not equal to x.

00:00:25.684 --> 00:00:28.589
Remember that the exclamation point just means Not.

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:30.233
We know that x is 20,

00:00:30.233 --> 00:00:32.939
so this is checking if five is not equal to

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:37.004
20 and since five isn't equal to 20, this is true.

00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:40.765
Then we check if 20 is equal to x.

00:00:40.765 --> 00:00:44.484
In other words if 20 is equal to 20. And this is true.

00:00:44.484 --> 00:00:49.289
And remember the equality comparison is always done with a double equal sign.

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.750
Next let's use our knowledge about decision making and

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.259
Boolean expressions to help us build program.
