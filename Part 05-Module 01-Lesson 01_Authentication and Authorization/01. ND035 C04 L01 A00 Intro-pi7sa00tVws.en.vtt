Hi, my name is Sareeta,

00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:04.184
and I'll be your trainer for this curriculum.

00:00:04.184 --> 00:00:08.969
I have about seven years of experience working in the Silicon Valley tech industry.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.830
Prior to that, I worked in India and I also helped multiple clients starting

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.320
with startups to top fortune 500 companies in the last decade.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.019
Currently, I work for a leading e-commerce company

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:24.449
as a senior developer and in my free time,

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.669
I also work on open-source project.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.140
That's all about me,

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.210
and I will introduce you now to

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.630
the curriculum that we will be covering for this particular course.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.185
The curriculum involves cross-cutting technologies.

00:00:37.185 --> 00:00:40.969
What that means is that we will be covering the technologies that are

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:46.024
used to build and deploy enterprise applications in the production environment.

00:00:46.024 --> 00:00:47.975
That's all about the introduction.

00:00:47.975 --> 00:00:50.439
Let's move to the next video.
