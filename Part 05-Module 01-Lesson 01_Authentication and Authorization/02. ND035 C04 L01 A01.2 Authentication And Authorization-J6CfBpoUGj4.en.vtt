00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.149
What is authentication?

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.384
In simple definition it means confirming your own identity.

00:00:08.384 --> 00:00:12.740
In real world, you would use a photo ID to authenticate yourself,

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.460
it could be a driver's license,

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.894
or your social security card that determines who you are.

00:00:17.894 --> 00:00:23.314
The form of authentication you can do digitally is usually username and password.

00:00:23.315 --> 00:00:27.815
There are other ways as well that you could use in order to authenticate yourself,

00:00:27.815 --> 00:00:30.650
like token-based authentication, where you have

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:34.265
an object that controls and proofs who you are.

00:00:34.265 --> 00:00:36.185
You could use OAuth,

00:00:36.185 --> 00:00:39.500
which is an external service which provides a token on behalf of

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.950
you to authenticate you to the external service.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.230
You could also use OTP,

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:47.875
which stands for One Time Password,

00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:50.414
which a lot of us have come across.

00:00:50.414 --> 00:00:52.920
You could have time-based token,

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.450
which is a token generated with something only you know.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.935
This token changes after some period of time,

00:00:59.935 --> 00:01:04.680
and JWT more on this we will discuss.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.355
You could have bio-metric authentication,

00:01:08.355 --> 00:01:12.395
fingerprints, facial recognition, face ID.

00:01:12.394 --> 00:01:16.924
These are the common other ways of authentication you use in today's world.

00:01:16.924 --> 00:01:19.414
We will focus on a few of them,

00:01:19.415 --> 00:01:23.210
which will be used with respect to rest APIs.

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:27.244
I'm going to summarize what this authentication means.

00:01:27.245 --> 00:01:29.719
In simple words, authentication well,

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:35.069
is a process to prove that you are a person who you say you are.
