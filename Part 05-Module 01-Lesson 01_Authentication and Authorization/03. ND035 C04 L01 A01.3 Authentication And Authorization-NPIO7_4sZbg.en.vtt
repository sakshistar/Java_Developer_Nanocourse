00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.530
Let's move into different authentication considerations.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.699
So the first authentication consideration we would keep in

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:13.349
mind is that the data use for authentication must be protected.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.564
It's as simple as you wouldn't tell people your password.

00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:20.990
The data must be sufficiently random.

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:25.279
So two things to keep in mind that will help us make

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.585
data random is the password length and complexity.

00:00:29.585 --> 00:00:33.245
Another point is the data must not be easily forged,

00:00:33.244 --> 00:00:37.299
which means that it needs to be deterministically generated.

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:40.759
The other point would be the same data should be able to

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:44.019
authenticate someone no matter the conditions.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.859
This is very obvious because you would want to login

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:54.480
to the same system with one password and not have to regenerate your password.
