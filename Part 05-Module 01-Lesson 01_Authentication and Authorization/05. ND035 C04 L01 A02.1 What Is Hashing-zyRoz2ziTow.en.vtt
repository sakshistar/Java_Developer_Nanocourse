00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.139
In the previous video, we introduced the concept of hashing.

00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:07.320
Now, let's get into what hashing really means.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.879
In simple terms, a hash is a one-way function that is used to generate a string,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.875
or hash, from a given message.

00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:19.390
It simply means that it is something that is impossible to construct from the input.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.819
Now, for example, multiplication of two large prime numbers,

00:00:23.818 --> 00:00:27.629
it is a one-way function because it is easy to compute,

00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:29.024
but hard to invert,

00:00:29.024 --> 00:00:31.709
as the inverse involves factoring.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.905
Now, let's say that you store the hashed value off the password.

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:41.865
So even if somebody has access to your database,

00:00:41.865 --> 00:00:44.560
what they can only see is the hash value,

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.265
but not the actual password.

00:00:46.265 --> 00:00:49.869
So they do not have enough to authenticate.
