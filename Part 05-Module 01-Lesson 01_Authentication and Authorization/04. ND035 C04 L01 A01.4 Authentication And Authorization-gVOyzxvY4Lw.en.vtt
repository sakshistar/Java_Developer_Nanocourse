00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.094
The next thing that we would discuss is the authentication protection.

00:00:04.094 --> 00:00:05.699
What I mean by this is,

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.175
how do you protect the authentication?

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:11.655
Let's think about a topic,

00:00:11.654 --> 00:00:16.019
let's think about an application that stores passwords.

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:21.134
Let's imagine and that the passwords are stored in simple text or plain text.

00:00:21.135 --> 00:00:24.060
Anybody who has access to your database

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:27.839
will then have access to all the passwords because they're in plain text.

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:33.585
Now, how do we solve this problem so that even when someone has access to a database,

00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:37.230
they cannot easily determined the passwords?

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:39.659
We will solve this with hashing.

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:42.789
More on this on the next video.
