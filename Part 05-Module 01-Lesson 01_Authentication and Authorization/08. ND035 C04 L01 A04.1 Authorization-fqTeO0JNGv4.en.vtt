00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.625
At this point in time let's introduce another security concept called authorization.

00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:08.160
Let's talk with the definition of authorization.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.199
What does authorization mean?

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:14.250
Authorization concerns itself with permission and rights.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.254
It says what authenticated user is allowed to access.

00:00:18.254 --> 00:00:23.160
Usually, authorization is implemented as role-based access control.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.250
So users have roles and access is given to the roles and not the users.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.704
What I mean by this is,

00:00:30.704 --> 00:00:35.250
let's take an application which is your company application.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.145
Let's say that there are two different types of roles,

00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:42.330
an engineering manager and individual contributors.

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.664
There will be part of the company site

00:00:45.664 --> 00:00:50.344
which only a manager has access to but not individual contributor.

00:00:50.344 --> 00:00:52.625
That makes them two different roles.

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:58.984
So both of them will have access to only certain parts of your company site.

00:00:58.984 --> 00:01:01.189
This is called limited access,

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:05.159
and that is what authorization allows you to do.
