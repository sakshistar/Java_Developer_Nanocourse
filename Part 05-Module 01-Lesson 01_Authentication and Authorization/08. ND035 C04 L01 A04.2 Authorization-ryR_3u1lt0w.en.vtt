00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.195
Let's talk about, how do we bring authentication and authorization together?

00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:11.445
How do we securely store user credentials and allow them to login?

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:15.780
Now, authentication and authorization go hand in hand.

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:19.785
You can't give authorization to unauthenticated users.

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:23.870
Generally, authorization is controlled entirely by the server.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.320
Users cannot grant themselves rights.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.940
It's easy to talk about an authentication token giving authorization,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.855
since authorization follows authentication.

00:00:35.854 --> 00:00:41.314
By that, authorization is a process by which sensitive piece of software

00:00:41.314 --> 00:00:47.489
allows access and operations that depend on the identity of the requesting user.
