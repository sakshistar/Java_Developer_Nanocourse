00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
In this lesson, we will learn to

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.810
very important security concepts; authentication and authorization.

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:12.089
We are going to primarily focus on two parts regarding authentication authorization,

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:15.599
the fundamentals of authentication and authorization and how

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.469
to implement JWT authentication on springboard APIs.

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:21.704
Let's start with the first question.

00:00:21.704 --> 00:00:23.189
Why bother?

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.835
Why do we bother about authentication authorization?

00:00:26.835 --> 00:00:31.500
The first important thing about authentication authorization is a data breaches.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.015
They are on the rise.

00:00:33.015 --> 00:00:36.219
The data stolen will triple in 5-years.

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:41.734
Three million people have had their data compromise from 2017 to 2018,

00:00:41.734 --> 00:00:43.265
that's a very big number.

00:00:43.265 --> 00:00:47.719
Data breaches are not only expensive but the numbers could be as high

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.604
as $7.9 million just alone in the United States of America.

00:00:52.604 --> 00:00:55.559
Worldwide, that number is $3.8

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:01.280
million and it is becoming harder to track and locate data breaches.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.620
For example in 2018,

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:09.230
the average amount of time taken to identify a breach was 196 days.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.715
That's really long time taken to find that there was a data breach.

00:01:13.715 --> 00:01:19.150
The annual global data breaches is about $2.1 trillion.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.880
By 2019 that's the number that it's supposed to breach.

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:29.769
The average cost data breach by 2020 will exceed over $150 million.

00:01:29.769 --> 00:01:33.039
Now these are some really big numbers.
