00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
Now let's talk about good Hash Function.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.434
Now, going back to the beginning of time,

00:00:09.433 --> 00:00:12.674
passwords used to be so stored in plain text,

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:17.774
and that's not very safe and we just discussed why.

00:00:17.774 --> 00:00:22.125
They came up with the algorithm MD5,

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:24.149
which is also no good,

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:32.295
and SHA-1 which had collision attacks and which is why it is also not good.

00:00:32.295 --> 00:00:36.725
Then there are common password hashing functions as well.

00:00:36.725 --> 00:00:43.939
The good algorithm Hash Functions that I would recommend would be bcrypt,

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:48.229
and there is also Arden to, scrypt is good.

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:51.439
So these will be some good Hash Functions that you could

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:56.204
use in your enterprise applications,

00:00:56.204 --> 00:01:02.655
because the most implementations of bcrypt uses 1,024 rounds by default.

00:01:02.655 --> 00:01:04.409
What this means is that,

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.204
the passwords are hashed, rehashed,

00:01:07.204 --> 00:01:14.969
and rehashed again, and this is done 1,024 times and makes it extremely hard to crack.
