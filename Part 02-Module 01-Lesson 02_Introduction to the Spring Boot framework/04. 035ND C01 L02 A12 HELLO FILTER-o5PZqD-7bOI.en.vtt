00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.990
You may notice the stack trace below when you're executing the Hello Filter example.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.605
This means filter will filter the request first,

00:00:10.605 --> 00:00:13.080
and runs a similar method,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.574
and future request after the similar method.

00:00:16.574 --> 00:00:20.219
We can use a filter to remove unnecessary information we want to

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:24.719
pass in request and response.
