you may notice that where this time using Bean instead of

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:15.899
servlet component scan to create a servlet, filter and listener.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.839
Before you jumped into to understand what a Bean is,

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:21.059
we want to know what is IoC?

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:28.210
IoC is a process in which an object define its dependencies without creating them.

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:32.579
For Bean, it's an object that is initiated,

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.880
assembled, and otherwise managed by a spring IoC container.
