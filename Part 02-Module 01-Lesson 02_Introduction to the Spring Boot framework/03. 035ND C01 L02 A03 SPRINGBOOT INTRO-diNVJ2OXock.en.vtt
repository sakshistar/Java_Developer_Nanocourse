00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.389
In this lesson, we're going to learn a Spring Boot.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.230
First, we are going to understand what Spring Boot

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.815
is and any other framework similar to Spring Boot,

00:00:12.814 --> 00:00:16.890
and why Spring Boot is better compared to then.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.100
We are going to create our first Spring Boot app from

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.070
scratch and understand Spring Boot application structure.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.920
The Spring Boot framework is probably

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.435
the most useful framework for Java-based microservice.

00:00:31.434 --> 00:00:37.074
Spring Boot is a good platform for Java developers

00:00:37.075 --> 00:00:43.210
to develop a stand along and production grade spring application.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.090
Developers can get started with

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:52.280
minimal configurations without the need for the entire Spring configuration setup.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.609
In a way, Spring Boot really help you to speed up

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:04.254
your application development without many required configuration need for Spring.

00:01:04.254 --> 00:01:09.369
I will compare this two framework in the next few videos.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:15.700
Here are some advantages Spring Boot framework provides to developers.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.710
The first, it will simplify your spring dependencies.

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:29.259
It can be run straight from command line with our application container.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.080
It build more with less code.

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:38.090
There's no need for XML, not even web.XML.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.710
There is auto-configuration you can use in Spring Boot application.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:51.495
They're useful tools for running in production, database initialization,

00:01:51.495 --> 00:01:58.829
environment specific config files, collecting metrics.

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.640
If the Spring is the cake,

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.530
Spring Boot it's the icing.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.250
Personally, I think this is a great comparison between Spring and Spring Boot.

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:13.609
Spring Boot and Spring frameworks are different in

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:22.985
this configuration, XML, controlling, use.

00:02:22.985 --> 00:02:26.760
In short both frameworks help you build

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:32.254
a web application and Spring Boot is built on top of the Spring framework.

00:02:32.254 --> 00:02:37.294
Well, you can build everything with Spring framework without using the Spring Boot.

00:02:37.294 --> 00:02:42.030
The Spring Boot can help you get the [inaudible] done really quick,

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:49.080
which is the reason why we're using Spring Boot over Spring in this course.
