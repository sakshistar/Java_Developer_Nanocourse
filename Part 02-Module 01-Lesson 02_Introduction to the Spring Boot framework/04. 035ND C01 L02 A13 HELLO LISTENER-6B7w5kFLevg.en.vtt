Servlet Listener is used for listening to events in a web container,

00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:11.289
such as, when you create a session or create a attribute in a session.

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.089
If you run the application correctly,

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.149
you may notice when you start the application,

00:00:19.399 --> 00:00:24.489

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.750
If you kill the application,

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.940
you'll notice this will be printed.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.439
