00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
In the last lesson, we have learned how to create a Spring Boot project

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.280
from scratch and how the Spring Boot project is structured.

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:12.464
In this lesson, we're going to learn more about springboard development.

00:00:12.464 --> 00:00:14.490
To start, we'll create

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.679
a Controller to make all our Spring Boot application a web application.

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:24.239
Before that, it's just running code like a command line app.

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:30.164
Then we're going to replace the Controller with the RestController.

00:00:30.164 --> 00:00:34.890
Then we are going to dig a little bit deeper

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.409
by implementing Servlet, Filter and Listener.

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:44.734
After that, we're going to see how to use

00:00:44.734 --> 00:00:50.254
resources in the static folder where we can create views.

00:00:50.255 --> 00:00:57.960
This all that, we're going to implement our Spring Boot application for file upload.
