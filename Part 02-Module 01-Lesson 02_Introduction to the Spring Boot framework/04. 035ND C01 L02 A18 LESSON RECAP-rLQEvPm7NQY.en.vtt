00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
Let's recap what we have learned in this lesson.

00:00:04.969 --> 00:00:09.524
We start with MicroService and MVC,

00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:13.710
then we introduced Spring Boot Framework.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.310
We built a simple Spring Boot application,

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.280
then with all the knowledge we have acquired,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.285
we build a FileUpload application.

00:00:25.285 --> 00:00:28.649
So we have covered a lot in this lesson,

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.709
and we have more fun stuff coming.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.359
I'll see you guys later.
