Servlet is a technology API or clause

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.594
that is used to handle requests in web applications.

00:00:08.595 --> 00:00:12.405
Servlet resides in server-side.

00:00:12.404 --> 00:00:17.640
Spring Boot use Servlet to receive requests from client side.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.480
There are two ways in Spring Boot to use Servlet,

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.435
which is using the Servlet components scan annotation,

00:00:27.434 --> 00:00:30.644
or using Bean annotation.

00:00:30.644 --> 00:00:35.740
I'm going to cover these two topics separately in the next video.
