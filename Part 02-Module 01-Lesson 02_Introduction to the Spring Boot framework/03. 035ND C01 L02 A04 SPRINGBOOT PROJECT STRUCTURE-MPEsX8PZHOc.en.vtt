00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.619
If you follow the instruction,

00:00:01.619 --> 00:00:04.349
let's take a look at the project you just created and get

00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:08.219
familiar with what each photo contains.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.359
So we're creating a source folder.

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:15.794
Inside of the source, we have a main package,

00:00:15.794 --> 00:00:21.644
Java, the com, and spring are all the packages we have.

00:00:21.644 --> 00:00:25.155
We have a HelloWorldApplication.java,

00:00:25.155 --> 00:00:30.100
which is the entry point of the Spring Boot application.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.704
Inside of the resource folder,

00:00:33.704 --> 00:00:36.839
we have application.properties file,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.405
which is a configuration file for the Spring Boot application

00:00:40.405 --> 00:00:44.924
where we can define the login information,

00:00:44.924 --> 00:00:47.699
debugging information, and change

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.365
the default configuration for the Spring Boot application.

00:00:52.365 --> 00:01:01.240
In here, we have a static folder where we can put other other HTMLs in here,

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.810
or images file, or CSS file in here,

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.725
or the static file inside this folder.

00:01:07.724 --> 00:01:10.484
For the template files folder,

00:01:10.484 --> 00:01:17.069
we put in our template engine or templates into this folder.

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:24.744
There is another folder called test where we put all our unit tests in here.

00:01:24.745 --> 00:01:27.109
It's similar to Java.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:34.105
In here is pom.xml is a Maven configuration file.

00:01:34.105 --> 00:01:38.250
Remember that we're creating the springboard application,

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.034
we are using the Maven based.

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:42.979
So if you're using Window,

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.460
there will be a different follow here.

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:50.644
So that's it off our Spring Boot project structure.

00:01:50.644 --> 00:01:53.519
Hopefully, you understand the structure,

00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:55.829
where you put each files,

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.530
and how to use each file in here.
