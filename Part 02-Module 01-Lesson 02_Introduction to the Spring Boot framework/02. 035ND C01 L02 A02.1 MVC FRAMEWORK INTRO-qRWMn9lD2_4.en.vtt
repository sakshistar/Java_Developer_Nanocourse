00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.785
MVC stands for Model, View, Controller,

00:00:04.785 --> 00:00:08.925
which is the architectural pattern that separates

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:15.839
an application into three logical components: the model,

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.059
the view, and the controller.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:28.570
Each of those components are built to handle specific development aspect of application.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.440
MVC is one of

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.465
the most frequently used industry-standard web application framework

00:00:36.465 --> 00:00:40.955
to create scalable and extensible projects.

00:00:40.954 --> 00:00:46.140
In the next video, I'm going to talk about each component separately.
