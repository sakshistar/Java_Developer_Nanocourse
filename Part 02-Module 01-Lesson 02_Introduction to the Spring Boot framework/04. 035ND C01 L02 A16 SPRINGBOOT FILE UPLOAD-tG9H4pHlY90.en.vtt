00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.935
If you set up correctly,

00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:05.714
I think you should have your file upload application ready.

00:00:05.714 --> 00:00:10.349
Let's see what else you can do in the application.

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.419
In case you want to change the configuration, for example,

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:18.554
if you have issue with uploading font size,

00:00:18.554 --> 00:00:24.189
you can update application.properties with the following statement.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:31.330
With this statement, you can change to a maximum font size.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.515
In case you want to try upload multiple files,

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:40.730
you can do the following statement in

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:46.289
the obligation.properties so that you can upload multiple files.
