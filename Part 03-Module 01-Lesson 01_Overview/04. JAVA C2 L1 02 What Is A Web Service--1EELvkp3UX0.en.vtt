00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.105
A Web service is a way to share data between two disparate systems,

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:09.945
or a way to retrieve data to display in your application.

00:00:09.945 --> 00:00:13.665
Web services are designed to communicate with other programs

00:00:13.664 --> 00:00:17.280
or applications rather than directly with users,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.470
and are often used to integrate systems allowing data to flow seamlessly between the two.
