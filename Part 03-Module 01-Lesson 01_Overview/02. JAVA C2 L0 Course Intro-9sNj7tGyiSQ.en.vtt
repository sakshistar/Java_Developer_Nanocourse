00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.745
Welcome to web services and APIs.

00:00:02.745 --> 00:00:04.485
My name is Kisho Williams.

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:09.734
I'm sure by now you've heard the terms web services, APIs, and microservices.

00:00:09.734 --> 00:00:11.529
The premise is the same.

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:14.324
Web services, APIs, and microservices

00:00:14.324 --> 00:00:17.714
allow you to share data between two separate systems.

00:00:17.714 --> 00:00:21.074
Essentially, integrate two totally different systems

00:00:21.074 --> 00:00:24.089
so that data can flow seamlessly between the two.

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:27.359
Web services are designed to communicate with other programs

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.750
or applications rather than directly with users.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.429
I will teach you how Java and more specifically the Spring framework which includes

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:41.210
Spring Boot makes it very easy for you to expose data in your systems to other systems,

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.884
integrate data from external systems into your systems,

00:00:44.884 --> 00:00:48.695
and quickly build your own custom web services from scratch.

00:00:48.695 --> 00:00:52.459
I will teach you about the fundamentals of web services, APIs,

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:56.575
and microservices, how they are similar and how they are different.

00:00:56.575 --> 00:00:58.275
While learning the fundamentals,

00:00:58.274 --> 00:01:02.119
you will explore Spring Boot for exposing data in your systems.

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:06.049
After providing an overview of web services and Spring Boot,

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.069
I will teach you about developing rest APIs and microservices.

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:13.729
I will then introduce you to a query language for APIs called

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.855
GraphQL and show you how to develop APIs using it.

00:01:17.855 --> 00:01:22.670
Then, we will discuss securing your web services and API endpoints.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.450
I will then show you how to consume existing web services in

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.010
the applications you develop to help speed up your delivery timeframe.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.400
Next, I will show you how to document the web services

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.925
you create so that others can use them effectively.

00:01:37.924 --> 00:01:42.484
Finally, we wrap up with me showing you how to efficiently conduct

00:01:42.484 --> 00:01:48.069
unit and integration testing of your web services using common testing framework.

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:49.824
By the end of the course,

00:01:49.825 --> 00:01:52.954
you will have developed and deployed your first web service.

00:01:52.954 --> 00:01:55.230
So let's get started.
