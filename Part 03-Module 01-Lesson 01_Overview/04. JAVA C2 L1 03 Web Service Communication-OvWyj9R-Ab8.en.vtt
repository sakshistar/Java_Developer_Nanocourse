The system's needing to communicate can be any combination of systems,

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.684
mobile phone to a Windows Server,

00:00:11.685 --> 00:00:15.150
a mainframe system to a Java web application

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.094
or even Web service to web service communication.

00:00:19.094 --> 00:00:23.969
For example, a web service created in a.NET platform can be

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:26.160
invoked by any client application

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.984
implemented in a different programming language like Java.

00:00:29.984 --> 00:00:32.534
Due to language transparency,

00:00:32.534 --> 00:00:34.769
you're able to develop services and

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.984
our client side code using the languages and tools you want.

00:00:38.984 --> 00:00:44.629
For example, you may have a client application running on your mobile phone that

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.390
retrieves its data from a web service running on

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.170
a server as opposed to data stored locally on the phone.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.590
The Uber app is a great example of this.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.820
The Uber app is downloaded and installed locally on your cell phone.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.980
However, that data for where

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:05.854
the nearest Uber driver is located is not stored locally on your phone.

00:01:05.855 --> 00:01:09.454
The Uber mobile app makes a web service call

00:01:09.454 --> 00:01:14.269
to retrieve that data from Uber application servers.
