Hello. I'm Keisha Williams.

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.675
Welcome to my course,

00:00:03.674 --> 00:00:05.879
Web Services and APIs.

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.134
Today, I'm going to teach you about web services.

00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:12.884
You will learn what web services are and how they work.

00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:15.809
I will tell you how to communicate with them using

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.574
common message formats like JSON and XML.

00:00:19.574 --> 00:00:25.244
I will then get you really excited about web services by discussing the benefits.

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:28.530
We wrap up with me clearing up the differences between

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.234
web services, APIs, and micro-services.

00:00:32.234 --> 00:00:34.659
So let's get started.
