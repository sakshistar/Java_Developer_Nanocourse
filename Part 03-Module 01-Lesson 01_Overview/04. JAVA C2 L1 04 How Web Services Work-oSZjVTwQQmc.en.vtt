00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.199
The communication typically happens between

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:12.204
a client and a server sometimes called the service provider.

00:00:12.205 --> 00:00:14.679
The client makes a request for data or

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.655
information and the server responds to that request.

00:00:18.655 --> 00:00:22.179
The means of communication between the two systems is via

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:29.234
a standard web protocol like HTTP or HTTPS over the worldwide web,

00:00:29.234 --> 00:00:35.590
and it uses a common language or message format like JSON or XML.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.025
Message formats are like different languages; English,

00:00:40.024 --> 00:00:42.695
Portuguese, Italian, et cetera,

00:00:42.695 --> 00:00:45.679
that allows systems to talk to each other.

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:53.030
Humans speak English or Portuguese or Italian while computers speak XML or JSON.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.910
Web services can provide data in a number of

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.304
different formats but XML and JSON are the most common.

00:01:00.304 --> 00:01:04.400
Extensible Markup Language or XML has long been

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.350
a popular way to structure data using a familiar markup language.

00:01:09.349 --> 00:01:12.649
JavaScript Object Notation or JSON is

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.350
a text-based data interchange format derived from the JavaScript scripting language.

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:23.409
It is formatted as key value pairs and is more lightweight than XML.

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:29.844
A client invokes a web service by sending an XML or JSON message,

00:01:29.844 --> 00:01:35.780
then waits for a corresponding XML response from the server.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.935
How does it work? The first step,

00:01:38.935 --> 00:01:40.674
the web service provider,

00:01:40.674 --> 00:01:43.789
the person who created the web service defines

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.215
a standard format for requests and also for the response provided.

00:01:48.215 --> 00:01:53.515
Next, the client makes a request of the web service across the network.

00:01:53.515 --> 00:01:58.939
Lastly, the web service receives that request and performs an action like

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:05.909
querie database or perform a calculation and sends a response back to the calling client.
