Web services support reusability of code.

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:10.769
Because they are meant to be small components,

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.709
they can be used by multiple systems.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.115
Web services makes sense when you need to reuse the same data in several applications.

00:00:20.114 --> 00:00:23.189
Let's say you're having your morning coffee and you

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.790
want to review the most recent posts in your LinkedIn feed.

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.174
Well, you can access that feed from the client app you downloaded on your phone.

00:00:32.174 --> 00:00:36.140
You can also open your computer and access your feed from

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.265
LinkedIn's web application that runs inside of a web browser.

00:00:40.265 --> 00:00:44.884
Behind the scenes, there's probably a web service that serves

00:00:44.884 --> 00:00:49.474
up the same data no matter from where you're trying to access that data,

00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:52.149
from your phone or from your computer.

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:59.015
Web services also promote usability as they are an easy way to expose business logic

00:00:59.015 --> 00:01:06.055
and data to other systems in a secure fashion to a wide range of audiences and platforms.

00:01:06.055 --> 00:01:09.740
These concepts of reusability and usability

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:14.449
allow organizations to use web services provided by third parties.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.745
This reduces development time and delivers more powerful applications.

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:26.840
For example, let's say your system is the source of truth for airport locations.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.600
Well, you can expose that data via a web service and now every client or

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:38.509
system on the planet that needs a list of airport locations can call your service.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.910
There is no need for each client to create

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.000
their own version of an airport listing service.
