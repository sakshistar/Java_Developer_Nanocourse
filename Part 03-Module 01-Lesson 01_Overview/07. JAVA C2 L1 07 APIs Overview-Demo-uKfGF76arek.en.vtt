00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:07.950
Let's look at testing an API in real time.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.775
So we're going to test a publicly available API.

00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:13.259
In order to do that,

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.419
I use a tool called Postman.

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:19.530
You can go to www.getPostman.com,

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.750
click on get started,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.594
and then download and install the version for your operating system.

00:00:26.594 --> 00:00:30.089
I've already downloaded and installed Postman.

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:36.073
I have the URL to the publicly available API and it's a joke API,

00:00:36.073 --> 00:00:41.149
so it returns random jokes related to computer programming.

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.754
So I'm going to paste that URL here and I'm going to issue

00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:52.585
a get request and all I need to do to test this API is to click the send button here.

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:59.465
Notice the response is a joke and it comes back in JSON.

00:00:59.465 --> 00:01:03.710
So in this case, this API uses JSON and not XML.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.879
So JSON is simply a key value pair.

00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:09.209
Here, it returns the id,

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:11.714
it returns the type of joke,

00:01:11.715 --> 00:01:13.993
it returns the setup,

00:01:13.993 --> 00:01:16.980
and it returns the punchline.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.734
If you click send again,

00:01:19.734 --> 00:01:25.265
it invokes that API and it returns another random joke.

00:01:25.265 --> 00:01:27.439
Again, we see an id,

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.084
the type, and the setup, and the punchline.

00:01:31.084 --> 00:01:32.269
So this one says,

00:01:32.269 --> 00:01:35.409
why did the scarecrow win an award?

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:41.314
The punchline is because he was outstanding in his field, very funny.

00:01:41.314 --> 00:01:48.504
So Postman is a useful tool for testing APIs and we will use it throughout this course.

00:01:48.504 --> 00:01:54.929
There you have it. You've seen how to test an API using Postman.
