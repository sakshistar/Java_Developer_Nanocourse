Hello, I'm [inaudible] Williams.

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.009
I have been in the IT industry for over 20 years,

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.419
and I've taught Java courses at the university level for over 11.

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:12.884
I currently serve as a Software Engineering Manager,

00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:15.750
leading and mentoring engineers as they build

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.644
next-generation Java applications that run in the Cloud.

00:00:19.644 --> 00:00:23.070
I've worked with the Java language since the early '90s,

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.254
and I've thoroughly enjoyed watching the language evolved over the years.

00:00:27.254 --> 00:00:31.214
I'm thrilled to be with you on your Java web services journey.

00:00:31.214 --> 00:00:33.609
So let's get started.
