00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.535
Today you learned about web services.

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:06.855
Web services are a way to share data between two disparate systems,

00:00:06.855 --> 00:00:10.380
essentially integrate two totally different systems,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.395
so that data can flow seamlessly between the two.

00:00:13.394 --> 00:00:16.094
You learned about the client and the server.

00:00:16.094 --> 00:00:18.539
The client makes a request for data,

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.589
or information, and the server responds to that request.

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.679
The means of communication between the two systems is

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.265
via a standard web protocol like HTTP,

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:32.625
or HTTPS over the World Wide Web,

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:36.765
and it uses a common language like JSON or XML.

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:41.750
You learned that web services promote usability and reusability,

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.200
and we wrapped up with me explaining the differences between

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.135
web services, APIs and microservices.

00:00:49.134 --> 00:00:52.579
APIs in microservices are more streamlined,

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.670
and easier to work with than web services.
