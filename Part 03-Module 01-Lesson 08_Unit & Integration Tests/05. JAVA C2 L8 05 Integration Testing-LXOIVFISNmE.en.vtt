00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.040
Integration testing allows for

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.250
testing of the entire application and all of its layers and not just individual units.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.469
It is useful to be able to do this without requiring deployment of the application.

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:19.979
The @SpringBootTest annotation is useful for

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.240
integration testing and is chosen over @webNBC tests

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:28.049
because @Spring Boot tests starts the full application contexts

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.865
including the server and does not customize component scanning at all.

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:36.539
@Spring Boot tests will look for the main configuration class,

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:40.350
annotate it with the @SpringBoot annotation and use that to start

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.340
a spring application contexts and simulates a calling client.
