00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.075
We've reached the end of the course.

00:00:03.075 --> 00:00:06.360
Thanks for following along with me and being fully engaged.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.390
You've mastered web services, micro-services,

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.035
and APIs and learned how to share data using them.

00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:17.699
You even learned how to re-use third party web services in your existing systems,

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.559
to help speed up your development.

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:24.179
You saw how easy Spring Boot makes it to develop rest APIs.

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.460
You were exposed to graph QL and the tool graphic

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.370
QL for sending queries and mutations to a graph QL server.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.070
We discussed the importance of security,

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.670
and securing the web services that provide access to your data.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.379
We use basic Auth to secure our rest API,

00:00:41.378 --> 00:00:45.379
and then discuss the importance of documentation and testing,

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.950
which are oftentimes the last things we do.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.470
But they should be a part of our normal development process.

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:56.030
You've seen how easy both unit and integration testing can be,

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.539
due to useful frameworks like J-Unit and Mockito.

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.265
I encourage you to take everything you've learned and fully embrace web services.

00:01:04.265 --> 00:01:07.019
Good luck on your learning journey.
