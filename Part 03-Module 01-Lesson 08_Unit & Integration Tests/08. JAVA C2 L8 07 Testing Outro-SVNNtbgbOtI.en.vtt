00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
Today, we learned about unit testing and integration testing using Spring Boot.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.460
We'd looked at testing using the @WebMVCTestAnnotation for

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.440
unit testing and the @SpringBootTest annotation for integration testing.

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:18.204
We saw how to mock the environment using MockMVC.

00:00:18.204 --> 00:00:22.014
MockMVC provides a powerful way to quickly test

00:00:22.015 --> 00:00:26.649
MVC controllers without needing to start a full HTTP server.

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:30.834
We also saw Mockito for mocking the data needed by our tests.

00:00:30.835 --> 00:00:35.274
The @MockBeanAnnotation works well with the Mockito library.

00:00:35.274 --> 00:00:38.454
We wrapped up by learning more about tests rest template

00:00:38.454 --> 00:00:43.250
allowing us to consume rest APIs during testing.
