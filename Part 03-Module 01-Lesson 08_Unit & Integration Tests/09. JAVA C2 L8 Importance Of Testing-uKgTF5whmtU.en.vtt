00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.089
I just wanted to take the time to reiterate the importance of

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:07.660
documentation and testing based on my years of experience in IT.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.390
I know in the world of

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.370
software development documentation and testing can be afterthoughts,

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:15.994
but I can express how important testing is,

00:00:15.994 --> 00:00:19.964
especially when you're working in an agile environment with CI/CD,

00:00:19.964 --> 00:00:22.934
continuous integration and continuous deployment.

00:00:22.934 --> 00:00:26.324
You really want to be sure that your one little change will not break

00:00:26.324 --> 00:00:30.030
other functionality that is working just fine in production.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.820
I currently serve as a software engineering manager with junior developers.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.289
I always encourage them to think about the person coming behind them that will be

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:43.774
maintaining their code or clients that will be using the systems they create.

00:00:43.774 --> 00:00:47.119
Documentation and testing may often be overlooked,

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:51.659
but they are necessities to help ease the maintenance process.
