00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.778
We will first look at unit testing REST APIs using JUnit,

00:00:05.778 --> 00:00:07.790
Mockito, and spring tests,

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.330
which is also known as MackMVC.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.900
Writing unit tests using JUnit allows you to test individual units of source code.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.070
JUnit is by far the most popular Unit Testing Framework.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.219
Mockito is a great mocking framework which we'll use to provide data for our JUnit tests.

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:30.000
Spring also has the @MockBean annotation,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.149
which works well with the Mockito Library by allowing

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.390
you to mock the dependent beings like the service layer being.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.970
@WebMVCTtest is an annotation used for controller layer unit testing,

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.530
and is often used to test one controller class at a time,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.109
and works in combination with Mockito to mock the dependencies.

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:53.789
@WebMVCTest scans only the controllers.

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.825
So @controllers, @RestControllers, and we'll not load the full application contexts.

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:01.280
In our case study,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.174
only the location controller will be scanned.

00:01:04.174 --> 00:01:06.424
If your controller has dependency on

00:01:06.424 --> 00:01:09.664
other beans for example a bean from the service layer,

00:01:09.665 --> 00:01:15.020
the test will not run until either you load the bin yourself or provide a mock for it.

00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:18.700
This is where the @MockBean annotation comes into play.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.439
Typically, you will need to provide the beans manually by mocking those objects.

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.039
@WebMVCTest speeds up testing by only

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.460
loading a small portion of your app for unit testing,

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:33.929
just the controller layer.
