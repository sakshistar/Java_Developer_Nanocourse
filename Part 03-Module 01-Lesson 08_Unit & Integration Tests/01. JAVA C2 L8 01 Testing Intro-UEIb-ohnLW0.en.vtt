00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.875
Hello, I'm Kisho Williams.

00:00:01.875 --> 00:00:03.209
Welcome to my course,

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:05.400
web services and APIs.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.750
Today, I'm going to teach you about the importance of testing your APIs.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.710
Testing should just be a normal part of your development process.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.400
First, unit testing your small piece and then integrating

00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:21.479
your piece with all of the other system components with integration testing.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.080
Today, we are going to look at testing with Spring Boot.

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:27.989
I will teach you about writing unit and integration tests,

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:30.149
leveraging features like the at

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:34.949
Spring Boot test annotation and the web MVC test annotation.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.730
I will also show you how to test using a mock environment.

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:42.375
I will also teach you about the Spring Boot tests rest template.

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.799
So let's get started.
