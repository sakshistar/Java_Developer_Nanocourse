Now, what I need you to do is try the same with Azure.

00:00:05.174 --> 00:00:10.064
If that is something that you prefer over AWS.

00:00:10.064 --> 00:00:12.884
They both are excellent choices,

00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:17.414
and here I have instructions that you can follow.

00:00:17.414 --> 00:00:20.969
That will also be a README that you can use in order

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:27.189
to check installation of Splunk on Microsoft Azure.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.640
I would give you the details for that as well,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.910
and why don't you go ahead and try that as a challenge?
