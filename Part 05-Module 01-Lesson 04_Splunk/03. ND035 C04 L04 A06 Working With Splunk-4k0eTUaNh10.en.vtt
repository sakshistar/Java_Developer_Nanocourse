00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.169
Now, working with Splunk can be of various types.

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:08.115
You could either be using a small enterprise deployment

00:00:08.115 --> 00:00:13.289
or large enterprise deployment or it could be your personal use as well.

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:18.134
When we look into small enterprise deployment,

00:00:18.135 --> 00:00:21.300
we are typically talking about one search head with

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.410
2-3 indexers and about 100-200 forwarders.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.660
In terms of large enterprise deployment,

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:35.340
it could be multiple search heads and 10-20 indexers and thousands of forwarders.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.870
Let's also get ourselves familiarized with

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:42.214
this particular document which I found extremely useful,

00:00:42.215 --> 00:00:45.050
which is available on the Splunk website.

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:46.924
Let's take a look at that.

00:00:46.924 --> 00:00:50.824
I'm going to provide the link to this documentation below the video.

00:00:50.825 --> 00:00:54.620
Let me take you through this document real quickly

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:59.189
and then you can read through them in your free time.

00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:05.105
So here, there is a bit of information about the architecture that they use,

00:01:05.105 --> 00:01:08.359
and this is pretty much the Splunk architecture.

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:10.700
It talks about the Splunk servers,

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.850
the different kinds of alerts that are available,

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:15.849
the modules that they offer, the data stores,

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:20.854
and different combination of that is available for different types of environment.

00:01:20.855 --> 00:01:23.480
Then it also talks about single host deployment,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.545
which pretty much means that you have a single machine.

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:29.840
You can also have distributed access which

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.780
is multiple machines in a distributed fashion that

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.534
can be used for forwarding data and for accessing as well.

00:01:38.534 --> 00:01:42.634
There is more information that talks about high availability.

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:47.975
So this is one document that you can probably read through very quickly to get an idea

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:54.329
of what they really mean and what they really talk about in the deployment process.
