00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.615
Now, let's look at some other options that are available over here.

00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:05.955
So here, you have the Settings,

00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:11.280
and something that I do challenge you to go and

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:17.669
explore is the Add Data option using Monitor and Forward.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.960
So with Forward, what you would be able to do is you'll be

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.505
able to create either a universal forwarder or a heavy forwarder.

00:00:26.504 --> 00:00:30.989
A universal forwarder is something that is going to be good for a single instance.

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:35.625
However, heavy forwarder is what you would use in an enterprise application.

00:00:35.625 --> 00:00:38.024
It will forward the raw data into Splunk.

00:00:38.024 --> 00:00:43.475
So there are details over here which is just going to be Select Forwarders.

00:00:43.475 --> 00:00:45.950
You go ahead and select a source.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.320
All you have to do is you have to follow

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.730
the instructions which are very extremely easy to use.

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:56.269
I would also link the instructions for how to

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.040
configure a heavy forwarder and a universal forwarder,

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.614
and that will help you practice how to forward data into Splunk as well.

00:01:05.614 --> 00:01:12.030
So that would be extremely good exercise to pursue as well.
