00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
Now, let's look at our local installation of Splunk.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.105
As we had seen earlier that is available to us at local-host 8,000 port,

00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:14.039
and on the left-hand side you have search and reporting options.

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:16.785
The moment you click that it offers you a tour.

00:00:16.785 --> 00:00:18.945
You can choose take it or skip it,

00:00:18.945 --> 00:00:21.975
and then you will come across this,

00:00:21.975 --> 00:00:24.525
this screen which is a search screen.

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:28.049
I do not have any datasets added yet,

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.215
but I'm going to teach you how you can add data to your Splunk index.

00:00:34.215 --> 00:00:37.320
So if you are interested you can go

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.405
over certain tutorials that are available to you on Splunk,

00:00:41.405 --> 00:00:47.780
and here I am going to talk to you about how you can add data to Splunk.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.225
So let's get into that.

00:00:50.225 --> 00:00:53.630
So now let's look at the local Splunk instance that you have

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.905
running which is available at local host 8,000,

00:00:57.905 --> 00:01:01.490
and let's try to add some data.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.359
So the option to add data is available under settings.

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:08.030
All you have to do is click on Add Data,

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.890
and that provides you the option of adding data.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.844
There was also the prompt that asks me if I wanted to go through the tutorial,

00:01:18.844 --> 00:01:22.204
feel free to take as many tutorials as you want from here as well.

00:01:22.204 --> 00:01:28.504
But here are the three options or the three ways you can get data into Splunk.

00:01:28.504 --> 00:01:30.994
We will start with upload.

00:01:30.995 --> 00:01:34.430
What upload basically does is that here you can have

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.970
your local log files or any structure files like

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:44.750
CSV and you can upload that by clicking on Upload here and just selecting the file,

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.109
and from local you can upload that.

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:51.769
The second option that you can have is monitor.

00:01:51.769 --> 00:01:56.224
What monitor does is that it allows you to configure the system

00:01:56.224 --> 00:02:00.919
or Splunk to get data from one of the files from your local system.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.650
So let's say that I have TCP/UDP,

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.890
and I can put the port number

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.944
here from where I would be listening and any overrides that I wanted to do,

00:02:11.944 --> 00:02:16.954
and I'll be able to click on Next and review the Input Settings,

00:02:16.954 --> 00:02:19.355
and then perform that as well.

00:02:19.354 --> 00:02:23.929
You can do the same for HTTP collector and other files and directories as well,

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.450
and so can you from scripts.

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:30.530
The last option would be using a forwarder.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.550
That is something that we will cover as well.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.575
So I'm going to start with uploading data.

00:02:36.574 --> 00:02:42.034
Now, for performing this what I need to do is I need to have a dataset.

00:02:42.034 --> 00:02:49.155
For the dataset what I'm going to do is I'm going to refer to these two open datasets,

00:02:49.155 --> 00:02:53.044
and this is something that I'm going to use for this.

00:02:53.044 --> 00:02:57.634
It's the transstats.bts.gov data,

00:02:57.634 --> 00:03:00.679
so I have that open here already.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.849
So here I have some statistical product.

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:11.889
I have some database directory, aviation.

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:14.889
So I'm taking American travel survey,

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.659
you can choose to download from anywhere.

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:20.569
For ease I'm just taking household characteristics.

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.204
This is all open datasets,

00:03:22.205 --> 00:03:27.070
and I'm going to add a series of data that I want,

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.629
a series of fields from this particular table.

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:37.704
Let me just add all of them or as many as I can add right now,

00:03:37.705 --> 00:03:43.760
and I am going to download this.

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:45.709
Once this data is downloaded,

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.830
the ZIP convert into a CSV which is what

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.340
I'm going to use in order to upload in the upload section.
