00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.919
What you would do in an enterprise application is you would

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:06.599
run an instance of Splunk in one of the machines.

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:10.695
So it could be either AWS or it could be either Azure.

00:00:10.695 --> 00:00:15.060
I'm going to show the flavors of both of them to you so that you understand

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.350
how to get an instance of Splunk in AWS.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.865
Let's get that going.

00:00:20.864 --> 00:00:22.604
So for doing that,

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:31.589
I would need to go to AWS site which is the aws.amazon.com.

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:32.939
Now below the video,

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:35.579
I'm going to provide detailed steps of

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.359
instructions that will help you install Splunk on AWS.

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:45.700
But for now, let's go ahead and start with AWS.

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:54.019
Okay. So you will be then routed to this page which has the option to sign up.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.120
Now when you click sign up,

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:58.820
it asks you to create an AWS account.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.429
I already have one,

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:04.819
but if you want to explore the AWS option,

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:08.449
you will need to create an account for yourself.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.790
So you need to pass your email,

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.765
password, and account name that's going to be used by AWS.

00:01:14.765 --> 00:01:19.069
The next step it will ask you to enter your credit card information,

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:22.459
but they also mentioned that the credit card does not

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:26.219
get charged if you are using the free tier.

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:29.689
So before you sign up or when you're

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.079
on the sign-up screen where you're providing your credit card information,

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.849
I need to carefully read the instructions so you are not incorrectly charged.

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:40.049
So I'm going to go ahead and log in to

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.834
my existing AWS account while you go ahead and create an account on AWS.

00:01:46.834 --> 00:01:51.474
So if you have logged in to AWS correctly,

00:01:51.474 --> 00:01:53.849
you would land on this page.

00:01:53.849 --> 00:02:01.714
Here, what I need you to do is look for Amazon Marketplace which is here AWS Marketplace.

00:02:01.715 --> 00:02:06.070
Here, I'm going to look for Splunk Enterprise,

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.469
which was also something that was there in

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:14.525
our local installation and this is the first one that I have.

00:02:14.525 --> 00:02:22.930
Now here, I need to click to subscribe and I'm going to continue to configuration.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.750
So here, it gives me a few options, fulfillment option.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.055
I'm going to stick to the default which is a 64-bit machine,

00:02:31.055 --> 00:02:33.004
and this is software version.

00:02:33.004 --> 00:02:38.269
I am going to choose the region that is closest to me which is

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.480
going to be California and I will click to launch.

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:48.694
So here, it gives me some options to review

00:02:48.694 --> 00:02:53.074
my configuration and see how I want to launch the software.

00:02:53.074 --> 00:02:57.589
Go ahead and take a look at the configuration details and see

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.435
if you wanted to play around with or get an idea of other fulfillment options.

00:03:02.435 --> 00:03:05.254
Here, there are several options available

00:03:05.254 --> 00:03:08.639
launched through EC2, websites, service catalog.

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.644
I'm going to stick to the default which is launched from website.

00:03:11.645 --> 00:03:15.530
The default these days available is c5.large.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.090
A few days ago, it used to be C3,

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.405
but I'm going to stick to the default again.

00:03:20.405 --> 00:03:22.965
This is the VPC settings,

00:03:22.965 --> 00:03:25.594
and I'm going to stick to the default again over here,

00:03:25.594 --> 00:03:27.965
this is nothing but your subnet settings,

00:03:27.965 --> 00:03:33.700
and it allows me to provide a security group which is by default.

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:38.389
I already have a key pair setting available which is sareeta.

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:41.389
But what you can do if you do not have this available

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:44.478
is click on create a key pair in EC2,

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:51.080
and what that will give you is this page where you can create a pair.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:57.010
So you click on create key pair and that will create a pair here with a fingerprint,

00:03:57.009 --> 00:04:00.724
and that's what would be available here once you refresh this option.

00:04:00.724 --> 00:04:03.905
So I already have one so I'm going to use that,

00:04:03.905 --> 00:04:06.235
and I'm going to click launch.

00:04:06.235 --> 00:04:09.180
Great. So it says congratulations,

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.870
an instance of the software successfully deployed on EC2.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.014
There, we successfully deployed our Splunk instance.

00:04:17.014 --> 00:04:20.240
So now that my instance is successfully started,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.689
I had to go back and change it from Ohio to

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:27.819
North California because that's where my deployment was successful.

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:30.074
So I have this one,

00:04:30.074 --> 00:04:32.569
this particular instance running.

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:36.920
So I would take the public IP information and

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:44.500
the default port at which Splunk gets deployed at is 8,000.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.074
So that is what I would use in order to check my Splunk instance.

00:04:50.074 --> 00:04:54.435
When you get to the console of Splunk,

00:04:54.435 --> 00:04:57.680
it would ask you for a username and password,

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:05.805
and that information is going to be something that you would pick up from here again,

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:10.655
which happens to be the pair of your instance ID,

00:05:10.654 --> 00:05:13.549
and then it will ask you to change the password.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.850
So here the instance ID is here.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.700
So you would use this as a user to login,

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:24.409
and then it will prompt you to enter the password and change it.

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.765
Actually to prompt you to change the password.

00:05:26.764 --> 00:05:29.990
So that will show you how

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:37.650
AWS instance will have Splunk or Splunk gets deployed on an AWS instance.
