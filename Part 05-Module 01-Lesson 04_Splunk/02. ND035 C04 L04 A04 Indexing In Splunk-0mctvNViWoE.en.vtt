Now, let's look at what we can index in Splunk.

00:00:03.225 --> 00:00:08.099
So Splunk helps you index various types of data.

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.353
That includes log files to alert,

00:00:11.353 --> 00:00:15.195
do messaging to any analytics,

00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:19.350
and it can take information from Cloud to bare metal to

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.255
databases to pretty much all systems including Linux.

00:00:24.254 --> 00:00:26.983
Here, if you have E-commerce application,

00:00:26.984 --> 00:00:30.450
you can just forward all that data to Splunk,

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.144
and then you will be able to derive some meaningful

00:00:35.145 --> 00:00:41.290
or easy to use form of these terabytes of data.
