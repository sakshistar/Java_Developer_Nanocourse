00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.139
We can now take a look at the official Splunk website and

00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:08.265
see what they say about why we should use Splunk.

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:12.405
Now, this is the Splunk official website.

00:00:12.404 --> 00:00:15.689
I'm going to provide the link to you below the video.

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:19.289
Let's look a little bit into what they have mentioned.

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.780
So in terms of functionalities,

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.320
it can provide insights when you need them.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.120
They can do rapid searches.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:34.179
The second thing that they mentioned is that you can scale reliably without stress.

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:39.765
Now, how does that explain why should we use Splunk?

00:00:39.765 --> 00:00:42.605
Now, every time you log

00:00:42.604 --> 00:00:46.419
the details of your application and derive some metrics out of it,

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.500
it gives you some sort of business insight into your application.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.890
Now, that tells you how you are growing as a project,

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.410
how you're growing as a company,

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:03.199
for example, how is the traffic increasing to your application.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.284
That will give you a projection.

00:01:05.284 --> 00:01:09.899
Now, that projection helps you to plan for the future,

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.940
which is what Splunk helps you do.

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.709
Splunk helps you to get

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:16.789
a graphical interpretation of

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.065
your growth and other SLAs that you might be interested in tracking.

00:01:21.064 --> 00:01:25.399
It also provides robust capabilities and Machine Learning,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.910
and it has an expansive ecosystem,

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.564
which is why we chose this as a preferred method

00:01:31.564 --> 00:01:36.299
for finding or running analysis on the metrics.
