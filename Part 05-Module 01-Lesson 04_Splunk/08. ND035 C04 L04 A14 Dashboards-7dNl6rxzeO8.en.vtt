00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.625
Let's learn how to create a dashboard.

00:00:02.625 --> 00:00:09.990
Let's say that I want to use the previous query and I want to run this,

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.605
or maybe I want to get a graph which tells me the top HHID or the count every one hour.

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:20.135
So this is how the search query is going to look like.

00:00:20.135 --> 00:00:25.859
I want to create a panel out of it or I want to create a dashboard out of it.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.480
So let's create that.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.074
So I clicked on Create new dashboard.

00:00:30.074 --> 00:00:32.310
The title is optional.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.260
I usually would add some meaningful title,

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:37.799
but for now, I'm just going to add test.

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:41.375
There are certain permissions available private or shared in the app.

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:42.679
If you keep it private,

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:44.149
this is only available for you.

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.420
I would usually use this for testing personally or I would just share it in the app.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.960
I'm going to keep it private for now,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.094
and I'm going to create a test dashboard.

00:00:54.094 --> 00:00:56.119
It says, this is already available.

00:00:56.119 --> 00:01:02.134
So I'm going to create a test1 and create a test1 dashboard.

00:01:02.134 --> 00:01:04.625
So I have the frame for a dashboard.

00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:08.004
What I need to create now is an panel.

00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:14.449
Now, let's get used to this particular screen and click on New.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.250
So over here, you would see that there are various forms of dat,

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.765
charts available like, line chart,

00:01:21.765 --> 00:01:25.079
area, column, bar, pie, scatter.

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:29.329
Well, you're free to go ahead and explore each of them.

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.650
I would recommend that you at least try the line and pie chart,

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.065
which are used a lot in the industry.

00:01:36.064 --> 00:01:40.504
For right now, I'm going to just stick to a line chart and I'm going to add

00:01:40.504 --> 00:01:43.069
the search string which was the string that

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:45.709
we had before which we have run the search on.

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:49.984
You can also try to implement it or run it from here.

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:55.039
Then I'm going to use a bucket on it which will help me

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:02.140
to find out the data at every hour.

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:13.180
So I'm going to use a default_time which has a time of indexing in it.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.165
I'm going to add one hour to it.

00:02:17.164 --> 00:02:19.264
This is my line chart.

00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:22.269
Let me see if everything looks good.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.159
Line chart with HHID,

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.680
and I would add this to dashboard.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.175
So this graph is what we created by adding that panel.

00:02:38.175 --> 00:02:40.930
As you see, this as a line chart and these are

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.580
the HHIDs that are available with the counts.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.450
So I did not add anything to the title.

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:52.459
You're free to add some title here. That's it.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.939
So this is how you would create a dashboard,

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.889
do not forget to save it for your future use.

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:00.244
Otherwise, this is going to not be available.

00:03:00.245 --> 00:03:03.094
You also get an option to export the PDF,

00:03:03.094 --> 00:03:09.319
which we'll take the screenshot or the state at this point in time,

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.875
which you can send to people that required this information.

00:03:12.875 --> 00:03:17.764
One more thing that might come in handy is being able to share these dashboards.

00:03:17.764 --> 00:03:23.769
All you do is either share on the app or you can just export it,

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.265
or you can also change permissions and make it available to them.

00:03:28.264 --> 00:03:30.904
So that's all about dashboards.

00:03:30.905 --> 00:03:34.115
But I encourage you to go ahead and create

00:03:34.115 --> 00:03:37.820
more dashboards and use different charts so that

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:44.689
you can see what it will look like when a pie chart or a bar graph or something else,

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:47.585
how does it look and does make any sense to you,

00:03:47.585 --> 00:03:51.469
and you can then put them right next to each other and make

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:56.859
some extremely nice analytics dashboard for yourself.
