00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.794
So let's look at the deployment model for Splunk.

00:00:03.794 --> 00:00:08.955
Let's say that these are the sources from where we can gather data.

00:00:08.955 --> 00:00:11.910
So this is where all the raw data comes from.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.294
We have something called a forwarder,

00:00:14.294 --> 00:00:16.214
which gets a raw data,

00:00:16.214 --> 00:00:21.859
and then that is used by the indexer to index the data,

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.780
and that is pulled by the search heads when they are queried from

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.385
all the different graphical user interfaces

00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:36.170
or they can be queried even without using graphical user interfaces.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.469
I will explain this in the next slide in more detail.

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:42.405
So like I mentioned, search head,

00:00:42.405 --> 00:00:45.079
what it does is it provides you

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.969
with a response to the request that you're trying to search.

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.225
The indexer converts a forwarders raw data into something called events.

00:00:55.225 --> 00:00:57.484
Now, this is a Splunk terminology.

00:00:57.484 --> 00:01:01.174
Then it indexes into something called a bucket.

00:01:01.174 --> 00:01:05.469
It's nothing but a space or a bucket.

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:09.215
Then we have a forwarder which can go to and fro.

00:01:09.215 --> 00:01:11.495
There are two types of forwarders,

00:01:11.495 --> 00:01:13.609
universal as well as heavy.

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:17.329
So let's look a little more detailed about this.

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:23.030
This is something that is available on the Splunk official website.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.284
So this describes the inputs,

00:01:26.284 --> 00:01:29.810
and then that go into the parsing queue.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.225
So this is the process of parsing,

00:01:32.224 --> 00:01:36.799
which is then indexed from the queue to the pipeline,

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.914
and then it's searched.

00:01:38.915 --> 00:01:42.390
So this is where the search actually happens.
