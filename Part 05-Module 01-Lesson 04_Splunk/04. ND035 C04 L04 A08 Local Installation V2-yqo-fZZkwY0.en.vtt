00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
So if you've completed your creation of free accounts successfully,

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.804
you will get to this screen and you can scroll down to the very bottom,

00:00:08.804 --> 00:00:14.175
and this is the option that we would choose in order to use Splunk today,

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:15.540
which is Splunk Enterprise,

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.004
which is also something that you would use in an enterprise application.

00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:21.869
So since my machine is Mac OS,

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.789
I'm going to choose that option but depending on your operating system,

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.094
you can either choose Windows or Linux and follow through.

00:00:31.094 --> 00:00:33.390
The steps are not very different.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.480
So I'm not going to repeat all these steps for you.

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:38.429
But if you have a Mac OS,

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:39.585
you can follow along.

00:00:39.585 --> 00:00:41.564
If you do not have a Mac OS,

00:00:41.564 --> 00:00:43.214
if you do not have the Mac OS,

00:00:43.215 --> 00:00:45.905
click to the correct one and follow along.

00:00:45.905 --> 00:00:48.649
So I'm just going to get the DMG downloaded.

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.265
So I've started the download and it's going to take some time

00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:55.490
while it finishes that and in the meantime,

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:01.609
I would show you how to run that same or download it from the Command Line using w get.

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.819
You just need to run this in your terminal and it would do

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:08.599
the same thing that is doing with the actual DMG download.

00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:12.144
So why don't you go ahead and give one of these a try?

00:01:12.144 --> 00:01:17.824
Okay. So my Splunk download has just finished and I'm going to open it

00:01:17.825 --> 00:01:20.299
like any other application that I download

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.939
and I'm trying to install this right now on my local.

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:28.685
I'm going to double-click on install Splunk.

00:01:28.685 --> 00:01:32.105
Continue continue agree.

00:01:32.105 --> 00:01:34.625
Installation type is fine.

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:37.730
You need to give it permissions for installation.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.850
So now it's giving me an information about brief installation initialization.

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:45.125
I'm going to allow it.

00:01:45.125 --> 00:01:50.390
It will run a few initialization steps.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.359
Now, this admin name and password is something that you need to remember

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:59.719
because this is what you would use in order to log in

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:03.200
to your local instance when you start the application.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.240
So here it says, confirm the password.

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:11.030
So the password did not meet complexity requirements.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:18.185
So I am going to add something that is longer than my password.

00:02:18.185 --> 00:02:23.569
Okay. So it just finished doing the initialization

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:29.104
and I'm going to start and show Splunk. All right.

00:02:29.104 --> 00:02:34.639
So by default, the application started on port 8,000.

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:38.644
So that is what is here I can see here.

00:02:38.645 --> 00:02:44.615
This is your local instance and this is how you would log into Splunk.

00:02:44.615 --> 00:02:51.665
Like I'd mentioned that you need to remember the installation password and username.

00:02:51.664 --> 00:02:53.794
So I'm going to plug in.

00:02:53.794 --> 00:02:57.829
You can choose to check that out and provide data.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.510
But here we go.

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:02.854
We have our Splunk instance running locally.

00:03:02.854 --> 00:03:06.109
Now, you have it running locally,

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.325
but this is what you would use or a local instance is what you would use

00:03:10.324 --> 00:03:15.364
when you're trying to test something locally or you're trying to do a POC.

00:03:15.365 --> 00:03:21.180
But this is not what do you would run in a big enterprise application.
