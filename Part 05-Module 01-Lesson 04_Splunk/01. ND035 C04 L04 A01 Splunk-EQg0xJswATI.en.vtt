00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.209
In this lesson, we will discuss Splunk.

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:06.195
Now, you must wonder what Splunk means

00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:10.230
and how do we connect this with what we learned in the past.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.929
Now, Splunk is nothing but our search engine for IT data.

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.585
Now, what is it searching?

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:21.675
Is it searching IoT data?

00:00:21.675 --> 00:00:24.195
Is it searching application data?

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:25.725
What exactly does it search,

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:29.685
or what does it provide the graphical user interface for?

00:00:29.684 --> 00:00:32.379
Let's look into that.
