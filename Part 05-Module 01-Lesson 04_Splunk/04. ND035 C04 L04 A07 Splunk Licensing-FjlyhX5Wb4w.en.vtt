00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
So Splunk provides a free license,

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.349
which is available for trial,

00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:05.835
and that's for 60 days.

00:00:05.835 --> 00:00:11.940
I will talk about a forwarder license that we would make use of in the next few slides.

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:15.570
So let's get into creating account for ourselves.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.070
It's very simple.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.050
All you do is go to splunk.com.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.675
Click on the Free Splunk option.

00:00:21.675 --> 00:00:25.019
I already have an account so I'm just going to log into that.

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.605
However, all you have to do is create a Cloud trial account,

00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:30.480
accept the terms and conditions,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.420
and follow the process in order to create your account.
