00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.875
So now, let's discuss two more new terminologies.

00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:07.080
One, search item.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.259
So search item is nothing but all the fields that are

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:14.175
available to you and another thing is search command.

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:19.185
A search command is a command that is available in SPL that can run

00:00:19.184 --> 00:00:24.914
something on the search items or some logic on the search items.

00:00:24.914 --> 00:00:29.250
So let me take you on this official Splunk website

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.439
again which has a list of search commands written for you.

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:41.369
A few that are extremely important and I keep using them over and over again is top.

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:44.164
Now, I'm going to just search for it

00:00:44.164 --> 00:00:48.200
because that is going to be easier than scrolling through the entire documentation.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.770
But here, you have details of the space

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.685
the most common values of a field which is the opposite of rare.

00:00:56.685 --> 00:00:58.940
Rare does just the opposite of that.

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:02.599
So you can go and check the documentation for that.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.724
It says, displays a least common values of a field.

00:01:06.724 --> 00:01:15.214
Now, some more commands that I have used a lot from Splunk are Table.

00:01:15.215 --> 00:01:19.230
Let me just look for that as well.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.394
Table. It creates a table using the specified fields,

00:01:24.394 --> 00:01:26.674
and another one would be stats.

00:01:26.674 --> 00:01:32.989
Now, stats works on timestamps or timestamps mostly.

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:34.909
That was not stats, that was tstats,

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.289
so I'm looking for stats.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.550
Gostats, mstats, okay.

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.604
Now, this provides statistics grouped optionally by fields.

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:51.439
So this is something that you would also use often or at least I have used often.

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.174
So now, let's try out a few from here.

00:01:55.174 --> 00:01:58.439
So here I have my dataset.

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.620
How you would take all the result from

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.914
the previous query to the next is by using a pipe operator.

00:02:08.914 --> 00:02:10.969
So I would use a pipe.

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:16.909
Pipe is available to you above the backslash button and now you get

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:19.759
a list of different kinds of commands that you can

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:23.090
run on whatever was a result from here.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.925
So again, do not be afraid of the pipe operator.

00:02:25.925 --> 00:02:31.085
All it does is it takes the value from the left hand side and

00:02:31.085 --> 00:02:36.844
it makes it available for any of the commands that you run after the pipe operation.

00:02:36.844 --> 00:02:41.319
So let's try to use top on this,

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.609
but before that I need a search query.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.765
So let me look at this dataset.

00:02:47.764 --> 00:02:51.859
So I see something called HHDI here.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.710
So I'm going to look for that.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:04.969
I would just look for HHID equals 046612,

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:10.544
and I'm going to first run this at this point in time, this entire set.

00:03:10.544 --> 00:03:19.849
Without this particular search query that I added is 337,520 events.

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.854
Now, that I've added this for all time,

00:03:22.854 --> 00:03:24.629
it changed to five.

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.259
So now, you know that the search was successful.

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:30.215
Let's try out one command and see how that works.

00:03:30.215 --> 00:03:33.830
So now, I'm going to use the pipe operator which is

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.750
going to take all the data or all of the search that was available,

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.270
search result that was available from here and give

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.350
that to the next part of the pipe to run a command on.

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.150
So let's start with top.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:55.825
I'm going to try to run this on HHID value and see what result this is going to give us.

00:03:55.824 --> 00:03:59.804
So here, it gave us the count,

00:03:59.805 --> 00:04:01.965
it gave us the percent,

00:04:01.965 --> 00:04:04.875
it gave us the value of HHID,

00:04:04.875 --> 00:04:06.884
and it gave us the exact count.

00:04:06.884 --> 00:04:09.299
Now, you see since this is top,

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.795
the maximum is on the top.

00:04:11.794 --> 00:04:13.909
The maximum count is available on the top.

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:15.875
If I change this to rare,

00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:18.529
it should do the opposite of what it did.

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:23.029
So here, it is listed in ascending order which is the count is

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:27.784
the least to the max and I'm going to go back to top.

00:04:27.785 --> 00:04:35.555
So it allows me to count or get the maximum count and the percentage for that as well.

00:04:35.555 --> 00:04:37.970
I hope you'll learn how to use top.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.815
I would recommend that you try the other search commands as well.

00:04:42.814 --> 00:04:44.899
They come in extremely handy and

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:50.979
the more analytics questions you come across from in your day-to-day life,

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.110
the more you'll get to use these commands and the

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.965
more comfortable you're going to get with them over a period of time.

00:04:57.964 --> 00:04:59.418
So as a challenge,

00:04:59.418 --> 00:05:04.430
I need you to try out at least three or four of these commands

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.069
and see how you can interact with the data

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:11.099
or what types of analytics you can draw out of them.
