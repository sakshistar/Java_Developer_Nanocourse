00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.844
Splunk is an application that can help us

00:00:04.844 --> 00:00:09.750
to provide search engine type functionalities for the IT data.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.599
So, whatever logs you enter or you wrote into the log files,

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.274
you will now be able to query it in a very meaningful fashion.

00:00:19.274 --> 00:00:23.399
You'll be able to see it in a graph form or a dashboard form.

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:25.739
You will not only be able to do that but you'll be able to

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:28.994
build alerts and reports on top of that.

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:32.759
Our preferred tool for today is Splunk.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.174
Splunk, as I mentioned,

00:00:35.174 --> 00:00:38.504
as a lot of people say is a business intelligence tool,

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:39.940
but it's not just that.

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:43.059
But it provides a lot more than that,

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.550
because it can consume structured as well as unstructured data.
