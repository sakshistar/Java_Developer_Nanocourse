00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.384
For this tic-tac-toe game whose characters X and O,

00:00:03.384 --> 00:00:06.684
are kept track of in a 2D array of characters named grid,

00:00:06.684 --> 00:00:10.954
which character do each of the following grid indices correspond to, X or O?

00:00:10.955 --> 00:00:14.205
Assume that the first index is the column

00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:18.225
that a character is in and the second index is the row that it's in.

00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:21.520
And type the character X or O for each answer.
