00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
Now that we've verified that we have a version of the Java Development Kit installed,

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.765
we have one more step before we start programming.

00:00:07.764 --> 00:00:10.574
We need to tell our computer where to find the development kit,

00:00:10.574 --> 00:00:14.109
and we do that by changing our computer's environment variables.

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:16.539
So, let's close out of this command prompt,

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.619
and to get to your computer's environment variables,

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.035
you'll first want to right click on your start menu,

00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:23.934
and go to your system.

00:00:23.934 --> 00:00:26.654
And system is just referring to your computer,

00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:29.455
so click on this.

00:00:29.454 --> 00:00:31.804
Then you should see a system Window pop up,

00:00:31.804 --> 00:00:36.939
and on the left, we have something called advanced system settings.

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:38.269
This is what we want to change,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.453
so click on this.

00:00:40.453 --> 00:00:44.900
This gets you to another Window, System Properties.

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.049
And at the bottom right of this Window,

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:50.154
is a button labeled Environment Variables.

00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:53.361
Environment variables affect how your computer runs,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.534
so make sure to follow along closely.

00:00:55.534 --> 00:00:58.464
So click on this Environment Variables button,

00:00:58.465 --> 00:01:03.975
and you should see another window that shows all the variables your computer recognizes.

00:01:03.975 --> 00:01:06.325
We're only interested in one thing here,

00:01:06.325 --> 00:01:08.115
and that's the path variable.

00:01:08.114 --> 00:01:11.379
The path is where a computer looks for programming resources,

00:01:11.379 --> 00:01:14.399
and we need to add our JDK to this path.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.630
So, select this path variable, and click Edit.

00:01:18.629 --> 00:01:20.935
You might already see some program files in here,

00:01:20.935 --> 00:01:24.784
and we want to add our downloaded JDK to this list.

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:27.969
To do that, we're first going to create a new variable,

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:32.260
and let's just name it, new, and press enter.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.085
Then with this still selected,

00:01:34.084 --> 00:01:38.069
we'll click Browse to find our JDK.

00:01:39.129 --> 00:01:44.174
First, go to your home directory, your C drive.

00:01:44.174 --> 00:01:46.944
And inside here, are your program files.

00:01:46.944 --> 00:01:51.819
You should have downloaded a version of the JDK to go in your program files (x86) folder.

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:54.104
So let's expand this.

00:01:54.105 --> 00:01:57.375
And in here is our Java folder, so click on that.

00:01:57.375 --> 00:01:59.355
Inside our Java folder,

00:01:59.355 --> 00:02:01.500
you'll see folders for our JDK and JRE.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.159
We're interested in the JDK.

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.750
And inside our JDK,

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.794
you should see this folder labeled bin.

00:02:09.794 --> 00:02:12.979
And this is what we want to add to our program file list.

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:19.500
So, select bin, and press OK. And then you should see your bin file appear in this list,

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.080
and we're almost done.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.190
Make sure to press OK as you exit this window.

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:28.995
And also make sure to press OK in this environment variables window.

00:02:28.995 --> 00:02:32.784
And we can close out of the rest of our windows.

00:02:32.784 --> 00:02:35.694
And now we're ready to write a simple program.

00:02:35.694 --> 00:02:38.655
You can use any text editor to write a Java program,

00:02:38.655 --> 00:02:41.205
and I'll be using Notepad.

00:02:41.205 --> 00:02:45.930
Notepad can be found in my applications under Windows accessories.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.025
You can also find notepad by searching for it.

00:02:49.025 --> 00:02:51.974
So, I'll open a new notepad document.

00:02:51.974 --> 00:02:56.134
And now we're ready to write a program in plain text, like this one.

00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:58.419
Here's a program that contains code that will

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:01.434
print out the string "HelloWorld!" to our computer screen.

00:03:01.435 --> 00:03:03.400
And I'll provide this code in the notes,

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.170
so that you can copy and paste this into

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:08.954
your own text document and don't have to write it all yourself.

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:13.260
So, first you see these words, public class HelloWorld.

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:19.459
And a class in Java is just a way to contain functions in code and refer to our program.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.034
So this class will be called HelloWorld.

00:03:22.034 --> 00:03:28.745
All one word with a capital H and a capital W. Then inside this is the main function,

00:03:28.745 --> 00:03:30.625
public static void main,

00:03:30.625 --> 00:03:34.900
and this is where our computer will go to read and actually execute code,

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.555
and we'll learn more about both classes and this main function later.

00:03:38.555 --> 00:03:41.740
So don't worry if you don't understand all of this right now.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.850
Just know that the code inside of our main function will be executed by our computer,

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.049
when we run this program.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.064
So inside main is this print code,

00:03:50.064 --> 00:03:51.710
which should look familiar.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.245
It's a print line statement that prints out HelloWorld.

00:03:55.245 --> 00:03:57.284
Now, to compile and execute this code,

00:03:57.284 --> 00:04:01.199
we first have to save this text as a Java file.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:04.609
So, let's go to file, and save.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.775
We won't be saving this as a text document,

00:04:06.775 --> 00:04:09.735
so make sure to change this to be All Files.

00:04:09.735 --> 00:04:14.935
And let's name this Java file the same as our class name, HelloWorld.java.

00:04:14.935 --> 00:04:23.939
So our full file name should be HelloWorld.java,

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:26.420
and I'm just going to save it on my desktop,

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.009
so that it will be easy to find.

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:30.980
So, I'm going to click save. And it's actually very

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.640
important that this document have the same name as our class.

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.599
The name HelloWorld, all one word with a capital h and capital

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.605
w. Now that we've saved this as a Java file,

00:04:42.605 --> 00:04:46.345
we can compile and run it from a Command Prompt Window.

00:04:46.345 --> 00:04:50.430
So let's open a Command Prompt like we've done before.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.180
My first command will be to navigate to the directory where my Java file is saved,

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.949
and that's my desktop.

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:58.723
So, I type cd, space,

00:04:58.723 --> 00:05:03.069
Desktop, and press enter.

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:06.973
And cd just means change directory.

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:09.099
Then, once we're in the right directory,

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.000
we need to compile our code.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.745
And to do that, we type in the name of our compiler,

00:05:13.745 --> 00:05:16.090
Javac, then a space,

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:18.974
and the name of our program,

00:05:18.975 --> 00:05:25.582
HelloWorld.java, and press enter.

00:05:25.581 --> 00:05:28.990
This might take a couple of seconds to compile,

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.340
and if it's successful, our command prompt will move on to another line.

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:34.464
If you get any errors,

00:05:34.464 --> 00:05:37.879
it's most likely because your computer can't find the Javac compiler,

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.764
because your environment variables haven't been changed,

00:05:40.764 --> 00:05:43.779
or maybe your file name doesn't match your class name.

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:44.814
So if you get an error,

00:05:44.814 --> 00:05:46.569
check on those potential sources,

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:49.764
environment variables and matching file name.

00:05:49.764 --> 00:05:51.685
And once this compile successfully,

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:54.459
our last step is to execute our code.

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:56.919
And we do that by typing in Java,

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.965
then a space, and the name of our program.

00:05:59.964 --> 00:06:03.429
This time without the Java extension.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.345
This word Java tells our computer that this is a Java program,

00:06:07.345 --> 00:06:11.200
and that this is the name of our program, HelloWorld.

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:13.985
So once you have those two words, press enter,

00:06:13.985 --> 00:06:17.395
and we should see the expected print output right below,

00:06:17.394 --> 00:06:20.192
Hello World. Great job.

00:06:20.192 --> 00:06:22.944
And we can run this program multiple times by just saying

00:06:22.944 --> 00:06:26.430
Java HelloWorld and pressing enter.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.025
But if we want to change anything,

00:06:28.024 --> 00:06:29.435
like the text that prints out,

00:06:29.435 --> 00:06:33.014
we have to go back to our text file, and change our code.

00:06:33.014 --> 00:06:35.360
In fact, let's go back and change our println so that

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.215
it prints Hello Java, instead of HelloWorld.

00:06:39.214 --> 00:06:41.949
I can go back to my notepad file,

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:46.029
and change this to Java and remember to save.

00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:48.459
Then if we go back to our command prompt,

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:54.834
we can run our program again, Java HelloWorld.

00:06:54.834 --> 00:06:56.034
But wait a second,

00:06:56.035 --> 00:06:59.435
this still prints out Hello World, not Hello Java.

00:06:59.435 --> 00:07:01.899
And that's because even for small changes,

00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:04.375
like changing the print output in our Java file,

00:07:04.375 --> 00:07:09.370
the whole file has to be compiled again before it will reflect the changes.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.050
And actually, you may have noticed

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.715
this extra file that's been created in the corner of our desktop.

00:07:14.714 --> 00:07:20.339
It's called HelloWorld.class, and it gets created when we first compile our code.

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:23.889
This is actually the output of our Javac compiler.

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:25.824
The compiler takes in a Java file,

00:07:25.824 --> 00:07:30.319
and creates a class file that our computer can understand.

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:31.675
So whenever we make a change,

00:07:31.675 --> 00:07:34.030
we have to compile our Java program again,

00:07:34.029 --> 00:07:39.792
by typing in Javac HelloWorld.java, and press enter.

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:48.180
Now let's try running this code again by typing java HelloWorld.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.240
And now it prints out the updated printline, Hello Java!

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.460
So writing code in a text editor like Notepad and

00:07:55.459 --> 00:07:58.639
then compiling and running it separately in the command prompt,

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:00.303
can get kind of tedious.

00:08:00.303 --> 00:08:02.729
Especially when you want to change anything in the code,

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.435
and to make it easier to organize and write code,

00:08:05.435 --> 00:08:08.314
we'll be downloading an Integrated Development Environment,

00:08:08.314 --> 00:08:09.639
also known as an IDE.

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:13.264
Development environments include Java compilers,

00:08:13.264 --> 00:08:18.004
so this will make it easier to write and run our code in the same application.

00:08:18.004 --> 00:08:21.699
There are a number of environments that help programmers code in Java,

00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:24.000
and we'll be using IntelliJ.
