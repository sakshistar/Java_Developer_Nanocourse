00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
Now that you've had experience writing

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.970
your own code and running it on your computer using IntelliJ,

00:00:04.969 --> 00:00:07.464
you're ready to start on the final project for this class.

00:00:07.464 --> 00:00:10.904
The project will be the complete code that we've started for a tic-tac-toe game.

00:00:10.904 --> 00:00:13.599
Software developers work together on code all the time,

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:16.339
so this would be a good practice for working on other people's code.

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:18.620
Yeah. We'll go through the code we've written in a bit,

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.100
but first let's see how to play the game.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.410
Tic-tac-toe game starts with a grid like this.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.690
Three by three and players take turn,

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.265
putting an X or an O in one of the empty spots. I'll be X's.

00:00:28.265 --> 00:00:31.649
I'll be O's. And then we take turns and two when we're trying to get three in

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:35.989
a row and we can do that diagonally, horizontally or vertically.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.700
Since I'm X's, I'm going to go first.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.050
And I win because

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:54.049
I got three in a row like that.

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:56.244
Oh man, I can't believe I didn't block that move.

00:00:56.244 --> 00:00:58.890
And right now it's easy for us to tell that X has won

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.969
but this is the part of our tic-tac-toe program that's incomplete.

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.439
Our current code can't detect wins like we can.

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.484
So we need your help to write code that checks win conditions.

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:10.230
You'll use your knowledge that you've learned in the lessons to test

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.520
conditions and look for three X's or O's in a row.

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:16.950
Next you'll see this tic-tac-toe program in more detail and you'll see how to

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.000
download the code we've prepared and bring it into IntelliJ so that you can complete it.
