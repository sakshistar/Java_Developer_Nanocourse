00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.589
Here's a tic-tac-toe grid where O's have won.

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:06.535
There are three in a row along this diagonal.

00:00:06.535 --> 00:00:11.780
Which grid indices do we need to check to know that this is a winning board?

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:15.709
Here are all nine indices for the nine spots on our grid.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.219
Again, assume the first index checks the column

00:00:18.219 --> 00:00:21.414
a character is in and the second tracks the row.

00:00:21.414 --> 00:00:24.099
And you should be checking three options total

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.350
for the three spots our program needs to check.
