00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.765
Now that you've installed a version of the Java development kit,

00:00:03.765 --> 00:00:07.710
you're almost ready to start writing Java programs on your own computer.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.000
You can write Java code in any simple text editor which we'll see in a bit.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.230
Then to run these programs,

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.394
you'll need to use a command prompt window,

00:00:15.394 --> 00:00:17.189
which looks like this.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.630
The command prompt is an application that let's you give your computer commands.

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:25.379
It's also sometimes called a command line, terminal, or shell.

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:27.390
I'm going to close this window and show you how to

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.260
find it and open up the command prompt yourself.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.945
The command prompt can be found by clicking on your Start Menu.

00:00:35.945 --> 00:00:38.060
Going to all your applications,

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.289
scroll down to your Windows system folder.

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:44.085
Expand this, and you should see your command prompt right here.

00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:50.929
You can also just search command or command prompt and the application should pop up.

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:53.679
So here's our command prompt window.

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:56.700
Inside, you can see the version of Windows that you're running,

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.273
which for me is version 10,

00:00:59.273 --> 00:01:02.430
and you can see this user's directory which varies by computer.

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.094
For me, it's Users\video.

00:01:05.094 --> 00:01:08.364
And then here, I can start typing commands.

00:01:08.364 --> 00:01:10.319
For my first command,

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:14.531
I'm just going to ask my computer what version of Java it has installed.

00:01:14.531 --> 00:01:17.594
This way, I can make sure that I've installed the correct version.

00:01:17.594 --> 00:01:21.200
To check this, I just type Java, space,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.120
then dash version, and then press enter,

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.740
and you should see something like this print out.

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:30.479
It shows me my version of Java,

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.405
which is a version of Java 8.

00:01:32.405 --> 00:01:35.070
And as of the time of this recording, May 25,

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:38.604
2016, this is the latest version.

00:01:38.605 --> 00:01:41.460
It also tells me that I have a Java Runtime Environment,

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:44.219
and it also says I have a Java VM,

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:46.849
which stands for virtual machine.

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:48.082
So this looks good.

00:01:48.082 --> 00:01:51.914
And if you don't see this or see something like a Java version not found message,

00:01:51.915 --> 00:01:53.970
then go back to the instructions for installing

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:58.075
the JDK and try installing again or troubleshooting from there.

00:01:58.075 --> 00:02:00.939
We'll need to have the Java development kit installed

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.564
before we move forward and write our own programs,

00:02:03.564 --> 00:02:06.950
so make sure you complete the step before you continue.
