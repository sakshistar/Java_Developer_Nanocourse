00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.104
Now that we've installed a version of the Java development kit,

00:00:03.104 --> 00:00:05.830
we can start writing Java programs.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.050
You can write Java code in any simple text editor which we'll see in a bit.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.355
Then to run these programs,

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:14.794
you'll need to use a terminal window which looks like this.

00:00:14.794 --> 00:00:18.600
The terminal is an application that let's you give your computer commands.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.435
It's also sometimes called a command line prompt or shell.

00:00:22.434 --> 00:00:24.689
I'm going to close this window and show you how to find

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.480
it and open up the terminal on your own computer.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.855
The terminal can be found by going to your Applications folder,

00:00:30.855 --> 00:00:33.895
then navigating to your Utilities folder,

00:00:33.895 --> 00:00:37.650
and it's in here, this application named Terminal,

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.109
and you can click on it to open it.

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:42.689
You can also do a simple spotlight search of

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:46.429
the word terminal and click on the correct application when it pops up.

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:47.939
Once you've open the terminal,

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:49.699
it should look like this.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.960
You can see the time that you last logged in,

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.564
and a user name here,

00:00:53.564 --> 00:00:58.079
which from my computer is Udacity and then I can start typing commands.

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.454
For my first command,

00:00:59.454 --> 00:01:03.314
I'm just going to ask my computer what version of Java it has installed.

00:01:03.314 --> 00:01:06.554
This way, I can make sure that I've installed the correct version.

00:01:06.555 --> 00:01:09.100
To check what version of Java is installed,

00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:10.554
I just type Java,

00:01:10.555 --> 00:01:13.855
a space, then dash version,

00:01:13.855 --> 00:01:16.755
and you should see something like this.

00:01:16.754 --> 00:01:18.704
It shows me my version of Java,

00:01:18.704 --> 00:01:22.560
which is a version of Java eight and as of the time of this recording,

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.159
May 19th, 2016, this is the latest version.

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.525
It tells me I have this run time environment and also, this Java VM.

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:36.629
VM stands for Virtual Machine. So this looks good.

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:41.024
And if you don't see this or see something like a Java version not found message,

00:01:41.025 --> 00:01:43.200
then go back to the instructions for installing

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.540
the Java development kit and try installing again or troubleshooting from there.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.859
We'll need to have a Java development kit

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.185
installed before we move forward and write our own programs.

00:01:53.185 --> 00:01:56.000
Make sure you complete this step before you continue.
