00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.359
So here, I've already downloaded IntelliJ,

00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:06.835
and written a few lines of code so you can see what it looks like.

00:00:06.835 --> 00:00:08.759
You can see that it has some built-in tools

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:11.164
that help you organize programs and functions,

00:00:11.164 --> 00:00:14.429
and it does color text highlighting so that you can easily distinguish

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.769
between types of variables and certain words that Java recognizes.

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:23.445
It also helps your member code syntax and functions with built-in code completion,

00:00:23.445 --> 00:00:26.984
and we'll be using this application for the rest of this class.

00:00:26.984 --> 00:00:30.629
To download IntelliJ, you can either search for its download link,

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:34.700
or I recommend just clicking on the link provided in the notes below.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.350
So here's what the download site looks like as of May 19th, 2016.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.390
Again, software changes all the time so I recommend looking at

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.789
the text instructions after this note to get

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.704
the most up-to-date information about downloading IntelliJ.

00:00:48.704 --> 00:00:55.034
You should see this page with download options for Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux.

00:00:55.034 --> 00:00:58.349
So make sure you have this Mac OS X version selected,

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.050
and we'll be downloading the free community version of IntelliJ.

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:04.545
So click on the download button.

00:01:04.545 --> 00:01:06.870
That will take you to this page,

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.840
and your computer will start downloading IntelliJ.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.700
This is a pretty big file so it might take

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.850
a few minutes depending on how fast your computer is.

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:16.890
After this download finishes,

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.070
click on it to start the installation.

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:22.829
After you've clicked, you should see this window pop up with

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.204
instructions to drag IntelliJ into your applications folder.

00:01:27.204 --> 00:01:30.655
This will add it to the applications that your computer can use.

00:01:30.655 --> 00:01:33.629
And this will take a few seconds.

00:01:33.629 --> 00:01:38.890
After that's done, click on it to open it up and see how to write Java programs.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.290
You might get a warning message saying,

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.800
"You've downloaded it from the internet,

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.155
are you sure you want to open it?"

00:01:43.155 --> 00:01:46.609
And just say, "Yes, open."

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:52.510
Next, I'll walk you through the IntelliJ environment and show

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.000
you how easy it is to create a "Hello, World!" program.
