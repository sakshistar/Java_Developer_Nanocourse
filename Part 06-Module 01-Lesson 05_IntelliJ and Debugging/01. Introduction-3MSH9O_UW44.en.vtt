00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.674
So far you've learned a lot about writing Java programs.

00:00:03.674 --> 00:00:06.945
And in this lesson, I'll show you how to run them on your own computer.

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:08.572
To create and run programs,

00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:10.679
your computer will need a few tools.

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.679
We'll be downloading and using two pieces of software.

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.990
The first is called the Java Development Kit.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.699
The second is an application called IntelliJ.

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.079
The Java Development kit includes the basic software you'll need to

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:27.134
run Java programs and IntelliJ includes extra tools that will help you edit and run code.

00:00:27.135 --> 00:00:29.755
And we'll learn more about both of these in a bit.

00:00:29.754 --> 00:00:31.259
Let's start by taking a closer look at

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.219
the Java Development Kit and some of the software it contains.
