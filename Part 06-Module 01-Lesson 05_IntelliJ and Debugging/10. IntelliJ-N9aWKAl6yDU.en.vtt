00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.929
Next, we'll be downloading IntelliJ,

00:00:01.929 --> 00:00:04.264
which makes running programs easy.

00:00:04.264 --> 00:00:07.439
IntelliJ is a development environment which is just another name for

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.550
an application that has extra tools that help us edit and run code.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.464
Most developers use a development environment like IntelliJ to help them create,

00:00:15.464 --> 00:00:17.789
compile, and run programs.

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.489
All of our programming examples and videos will be done using IntelliJ.

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:24.109
So we suggest that you use this environment too.

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.475
But if you already have some experience programming

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:29.440
and want to use another environment, that's okay too.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.589
Just keep in mind that a different environment may

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:34.465
have different features and probably a different look.

00:00:34.465 --> 00:00:37.815
Also, most software like IntelliJ and the Java Development kit

00:00:37.814 --> 00:00:41.579
that it uses will include updates and will change over time.

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.725
So I recommend watching the installation videos to get an idea of the process.

00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:48.551
And then for the most up-to-date and complete instructions,

00:00:48.551 --> 00:00:51.664
check the text instructions that follow each video.

00:00:51.664 --> 00:00:56.057
I'll walk through to how to download and install IntelliJ for Windows and Mac,

00:00:56.057 --> 00:01:00.000
so click the option that's most suited to you to go to the correct video.
