00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.544
Because Java is so widely used by software developers,

00:00:03.544 --> 00:00:05.615
there's already a Java Development Kit,

00:00:05.615 --> 00:00:07.070
usually called the JDK,

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.190
available for download by any developer on Oracle's website.

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:13.265
Oracle is the company that owns Java,

00:00:13.265 --> 00:00:16.519
and their development kit includes two main tools: one,

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:18.594
the Java Runtime Environment and two,

00:00:18.594 --> 00:00:20.390
a Java compiler called javac.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.750
The Java Runtime Environment includes

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.589
the code behind all the variable types and functions that Java has built in,

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:30.039
like the println function.

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.284
The Runtime Environment also includes a Java Virtual Machine,

00:00:33.284 --> 00:00:37.994
which is basically a downloadable machine that allows Java code to run on any computer,

00:00:37.994 --> 00:00:41.034
whether it's a Windows, a Mac or another platform.

00:00:41.034 --> 00:00:44.894
And lots of computers already have the Runtime Environment installed

00:00:44.895 --> 00:00:49.265
because it's needed to run any Java applications that appear on web pages.

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:52.375
But to develop our own programs and Java apps,

00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:55.201
we need a second tool, the Java Compiler.

00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:58.480
A compiler is a special type of program.

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:01.899
It translates code written in a particular programming language like

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.454
Java into a form that a computer can actually understand and run.

00:01:06.454 --> 00:01:11.025
Computers at their most basic level only react to electronic signals,

00:01:11.025 --> 00:01:15.310
and so, seeing code like a print line statement doesn't mean much to them.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.975
The code developers write has to be translated into machine code,

00:01:18.974 --> 00:01:23.625
which is usually a series of zeros and ones that our computer circuitry can respond to,

00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:28.939
and the compiler is the first step in translating our Java code into machine code.

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.359
For example, the main compiler for Java is called javac,

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:37.799
and its job is to read the Java code that we write and translate it into a different,

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.024
more compact code called bytecode.

00:01:41.025 --> 00:01:43.880
Here's the whole translation pipeline.

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:46.489
Any Java code you write like this Hello world!

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:52.354
print line statement will get compiled into bytecode by our Java Compiler, javac.

00:01:52.355 --> 00:01:55.935
Then this bytecode gets passed to the Java Virtual Machine,

00:01:55.935 --> 00:02:00.424
which does the final translation step and translates this into machine code.

00:02:00.424 --> 00:02:03.920
This is the code that your computer understands.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.770
So, then you see the execution of your code on your computer screen, this print output.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.390
You might be wondering why the compiler doesn't

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:14.819
translate your Java code to machine code straight away.

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.625
Why is there this extra virtual machine translation step?

00:02:18.625 --> 00:02:22.930
Well, the Java Virtual Machine is one of the coolest things about Java because

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.305
it works differently depending on the type of operating system it's on.

00:02:27.305 --> 00:02:28.585
So if it's on Windows,

00:02:28.585 --> 00:02:30.500
Mac or even a mobile device,

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.985
all these platforms need slightly different machine code to work,

00:02:33.985 --> 00:02:36.880
and the virtual machine will translate bytecode into

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.340
the correct machine code for any platform it's on.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.004
So, Java programs can run on any device.

00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:46.909
Again, the Java Development Kit contains

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:50.764
both this virtual machine and a Java Compiler, javac.

00:02:50.764 --> 00:02:53.494
So next you'll see how to download and install this kit,

00:02:53.495 --> 00:02:57.000
so that you'll have all you need to start programming on your own computer.
