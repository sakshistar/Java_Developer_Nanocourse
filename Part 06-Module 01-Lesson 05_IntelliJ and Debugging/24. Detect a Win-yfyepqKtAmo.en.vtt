00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.290
We need to tell our program to check these three spots.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.799
Grid[2][0], grid[1][1], and grid[0][2].

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.699
Knowing that this first index is our column, and the second,

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:16.719
our row number, we know that grid[2][0] is the top right corner of our grid.

00:00:16.719 --> 00:00:23.085
Grid[1][1] is this middle spot and grid[0][2] is this bottom left.

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:25.955
And since these three spots are equal to the character O,

00:00:25.954 --> 00:00:28.684
we know that this is a win.

00:00:28.684 --> 00:00:30.890
Next, you'll see the project rubric and learn how to

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.000
submit your complete win detection code. Good luck.
