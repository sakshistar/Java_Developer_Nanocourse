00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.695
Today you learned about securing rest APIs using springs security.

00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:09.285
We covered security basics like authentication and authorization.

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:13.650
Authentication is about validating the identity of a client,

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.000
that is attempting to call a web service that accesses your secure data.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.065
Authorization is the next step after authentication.

00:00:22.065 --> 00:00:24.554
So once the client is authenticated,

00:00:24.554 --> 00:00:26.564
they have proven who they are,

00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:28.679
what do they have access to?

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.765
Next, you learned about basic off as a way to protect your APIs.

00:00:33.765 --> 00:00:36.990
Lastly, we integrated spring security into

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.304
a rest API to allow only authorized users to retrieve data from it.

00:00:42.304 --> 00:00:44.840
Next, we will learn about consuming

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.880
an existing soap web service or rest API in your existing application.
