00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.875
Let's discuss a few common web service security principles.

00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:07.484
Authentication and authorization.

00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:11.070
Authentication is about validating the identity of

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.855
a client that is attempting to call a web service that access is secure data.

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:22.005
Typically, identity is validated with user credentials such as username and password.

00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:26.794
Authentication is simply like unlocking your phone with your pass code.

00:00:26.795 --> 00:00:28.610
This step says yes,

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.399
I have access to what's on this phone.

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.539
Authorization is the next step after authentication.

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:37.644
Once the client is authenticated,

00:00:37.645 --> 00:00:39.355
they have proven who they are,

00:00:39.354 --> 00:00:41.390
what do they have access to.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.130
For example, what data can they view?

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.155
Are they allowed to change that data?

00:00:46.155 --> 00:00:51.859
Etc. This concept is similar to sharing a Google Doc with collaborators.

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:55.219
Once you share that document with a person via email and they

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.984
use that email to access the document, what can they do?

00:00:58.984 --> 00:01:02.969
Can they just view the data or can they edit it too?
