When allowing access to data via web services, security is important.

00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:12.839
We want to limit who can view or even update data.

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:15.990
Only trusted individuals should have access.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.734
So how does web service security work?

00:00:18.734 --> 00:00:21.719
Let's use a cell phone as an example.

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:24.960
In order to open your cell phone to call your friend,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.200
you have to unlock your phone by entering a pass code.

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.754
The past code is like the key or the token used to secure a web service.

00:00:33.755 --> 00:00:37.730
Let's say your friend will not answer calls from random numbers,

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:41.344
and she only answers your call because she knows it's you.

00:00:41.344 --> 00:00:46.269
You are able to call her because you had the key or token to unlock your phone.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.760
Web services that are secure behave in a similar manner.

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:53.644
If an unsecured request is made to a web service to retrieve data.

00:00:53.645 --> 00:00:59.880
If that requests lacks the proper key or API token that request is rejected.
