00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.055
Hello, I'm Kesha Williams.

00:00:02.055 --> 00:00:03.285
Welcome to my course,

00:00:03.285 --> 00:00:05.550
Web Services and APIs.

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.754
Today, I'm going to teach you about securing your REST APIs using Spring Security.

00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:13.575
I will first give you an overview of security,

00:00:13.574 --> 00:00:18.015
and cover security concepts like authorization and authentication.

00:00:18.015 --> 00:00:21.330
Next, I will teach you about basic authentication,

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:23.594
sometimes simplified as Basic Auth.

00:00:23.594 --> 00:00:26.549
It is a common way to secure APIs.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.699
Lastly, we will integrate Spring Security into

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.085
a REST API to allow only authorized users to retrieve data from it.

00:00:35.085 --> 00:00:37.750
So let's get started.
