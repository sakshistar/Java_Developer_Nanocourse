00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:08.535
Spring Security is a part of the Spring framework and provides authentication,

00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:13.185
authorization, and security features for Spring-based applications,

00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:15.585
in this case, our REST API.

00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:20.219
We have a simple REST API that returns a list of locations.

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:23.309
It has the web controller, the service layer,

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:24.884
and the repository layer,

00:00:24.885 --> 00:00:27.000
and an H2 database.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.365
The next step is to protect this API with security.

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:34.179
So let's do just that.
