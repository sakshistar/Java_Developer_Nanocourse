00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.554
Basic Authentication, also referred to as Basic Auth,

00:00:06.554 --> 00:00:12.809
is the simplest protocol available for performing Web Service authentication over HTTP.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.769
Basic Auth only requires a username and password.

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:20.594
The client calling the Web Service takes these two credentials,

00:00:20.594 --> 00:00:23.759
converts them to a single base 64 encoded

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.845
value and passes it along in the authentication HTTP header.

00:00:28.844 --> 00:00:31.679
The server compares the values passed into

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.884
the username and password credentials it has stored.

00:00:34.884 --> 00:00:40.469
If it matches, the server fulfills the requests and provides access to the data.

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.564
If the authentication HTTP header is missing or the password doesn't match the username,

00:00:46.564 --> 00:00:50.929
the server denies access and returns a 401 status code,

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:53.990
which means the request is unauthorized.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.940
API Key Authentication is another technique used to secure Web Services,

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:03.814
which requires the API to be accessed with a unique key.

00:01:03.814 --> 00:01:08.129
This unique key is like the pass code to your phone.
