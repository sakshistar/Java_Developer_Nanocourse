00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
Congratulations, you finish the last lesson of this course.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.175
Let's recap what we have learned in this lesson.

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:09.915
You use the Mongo driver,

00:00:09.914 --> 00:00:13.125
to do basic, read, and update operations.

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:16.050
You created spring data repositories and

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.900
road test for them using the Spring Test Framework.

00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:24.079
Throughout this course, you have learned many abstractions.

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:27.250
For relational databases, you use JDBC,

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.120
the GPA, and Spring Data GPA.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.570
For MongoDB, you use the MongoDB Driver and Spring Data MongoDB.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.340
As a developer, these abstractions make your life easier but

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.100
that is no reason to skip the underlying concepts that support these abstractions.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.000
Understanding the fundamentals makes you a better developer

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.200
and allows you to learn newer abstractions faster.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.980
Congratulations again on completing the course, and happy learning.
