00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.065
Let's see how to use the Mongo driver to query documents.

00:00:04.065 --> 00:00:06.060
I've inserted a few documents into

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:10.364
the patient's collection to help me demonstrate the querying capabilities.

00:00:10.365 --> 00:00:14.609
We have the usual steps of creating a Mongo client,

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:19.829
getting the database, and getting a collection.

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:24.989
Then I have the various ways of using the Find method.

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:27.329
Find with an argument,

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.464
find with a logical operator,

00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:33.524
and find with an array field,

00:00:33.524 --> 00:00:40.449
and also a sub-document then I have the sort or here,

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:46.579
I've count and also the limit.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:53.060
And finally a combination of find, sort and limit.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:59.490
Let's run this class to see if all these operations complete successfully.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.840
In the logs, we see the messages for each of the commands that we executed.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.945
You can see the array find over here and the sub document find over here,

00:01:20.944 --> 00:01:23.179
the sorted set of documents are here,

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.160
he count, the limit and finally the combination.

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.629
There you go. You just learned how to query documents using the Mongo driver.
