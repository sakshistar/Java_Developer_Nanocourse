00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
Welcome to Lesson 4, MongoDB for Java.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.265
You're almost there. This is the last lesson for this course.

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:09.750
In the previous lesson,

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.439
you learned about the basics of MongoDB and its document model.

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:17.829
Now, it's time to use it in your Java application.

00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:21.329
Just like relational databases,

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:28.139
MongoDB also has a driver that speaks the protocol that the MongoDB server understands.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.120
Point to note, this driver does not implement JDBC.

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:38.864
Java does not provide a unified interface for accessing non-relational databases,

00:00:38.865 --> 00:00:43.215
since each of them have their own unique data model.

00:00:43.215 --> 00:00:45.660
In this lesson, you will use

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:50.284
the MongoDB Driver to do some basic crud operations on documents,

00:00:50.284 --> 00:00:54.469
and create repositories using spring data.

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.979
Finally, you will test your MongoDB code using

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.984
spring test and then embedded MongoDB implementation.

00:01:01.984 --> 00:01:05.069
Let's get on with the lesson.
