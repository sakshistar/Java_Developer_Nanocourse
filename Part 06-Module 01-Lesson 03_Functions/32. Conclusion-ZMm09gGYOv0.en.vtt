I'm so glad you wrote everything in functions.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.370
Well, that's the way to go.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.185
It makes everything a lot more organized,

00:00:06.184 --> 00:00:08.300
easier to change, and easier to reuse.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.940
That's true. Not to mention that having all your code in

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:14.689
various functions helps us a lot with what we're going to learn in the next lesson.

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:17.140
You will be able to use something called loops to program

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.000
the computer to repeat stuff for you. Let's see how.
