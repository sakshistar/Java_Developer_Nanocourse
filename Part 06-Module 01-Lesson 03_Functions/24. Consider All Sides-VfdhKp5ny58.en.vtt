Hey Suzanne what you doing?

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:06.764
I'm trying to win this game Dungeons and Dice Monsters.

00:00:06.764 --> 00:00:09.684
But they have all these six-sided dice and it needs eight-sided,

00:00:09.685 --> 00:00:11.964
10-sided, and 20-sided to play.

00:00:11.964 --> 00:00:15.939
Would it be really cool to have a Java program that does all these dice rolling for us?

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:18.625
We could have a different function for each number of sides,

00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:22.940
like a function for six-sided dice and another for an eight-sided dice and so on.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.714
Well, we could write a different dice function for each kind of dice.

00:00:25.714 --> 00:00:28.870
But the code inside each function would have pretty much the same math.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.182
It's just that the range of the dice roll would change from one through six,

00:00:32.182 --> 00:00:34.365
to one through eight, 10, and so on.

00:00:34.365 --> 00:00:36.100
Yeah, it's definitely easiest to use

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.000
the same function and give it the number of side it needs every time.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.689
Then it could give us the correct range.

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:44.219
Providing the number of sides sounds like a job for parameters.

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.000
Let's use the power of input and output to improve our rollDice function.
