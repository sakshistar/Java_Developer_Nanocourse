00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
Let's make a function for printing that takes in

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.929
a width and height in centimeters for the photo or picture we want to print.

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:08.400
Like this picture of Duke,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.320
who's the Java mascot.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.490
We also want our function to have a parameter for a boolean inColor.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.625
InColor should be true for color prints and false for black and white ones.

00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:21.750
Then we want our function to print out a description of this print.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.030
This function called printPhoto,

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.885
takes in these three parameters width, height and inColor.

00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:29.785
And you can include even more than this,

00:00:29.785 --> 00:00:32.539
as long as you separate the parameters with commas.

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:34.740
So we can include more information like a string for

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.990
texture or float for price and so on,

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.469
but let's stick with these three parameters for now.

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.350
To color printPhoto function for different sizes and colors it prints,

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.020
we have to provide the three pieces of information that

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.470
this function expects in the order that specified.

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.369
First we have an int argument that will correspond to our width parameter.

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:55.259
Then we have another int argument that will

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:57.989
correspond to our height parameter and finally,

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.829
a third boolean describing whether this print should be in color or not.

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.250
We can describe a 30 cm by 40 cm color photo by calling printPhoto with 30,

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.670
40 and true as our arguments.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.659
Again, these arguments are matched to

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.375
the type and order of parameters in the function definition.

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:20.625
Our first argument 30 is to match with our first parameter and width.

00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:24.609
Our second argument 40 is matched to our second parameter and height,

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:28.724
and our third argument true is matched to our third parameter boolean inColor.

00:01:28.724 --> 00:01:29.959
For this function call,

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:31.469
we'll have this print output.

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:35.310
Java will see these arguments and enter a function definition.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.320
It will print out 30 for the width,

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:41.829
40 centimeters for the height and then because inColor is true,

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:43.905
print is full color.

00:01:43.905 --> 00:01:46.814
The order that we put these arguments into our function call

00:01:46.814 --> 00:01:50.000
is really important which we'll see in more detail next.
