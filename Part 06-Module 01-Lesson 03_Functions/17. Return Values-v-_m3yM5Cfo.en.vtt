00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.825
Not only can functions take in data as parameters,

00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:06.105
they can also return data to you.

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:09.294
This data is called, the return value of a function.

00:00:09.294 --> 00:00:14.070
Our parameters can act as input to functions and their return value is its output,

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.140
and their return value is defined by

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.490
the return type we've seen in our function definitions.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.259
So far, we've been making functions that look like this,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.210
with a return type of void.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.109
Void means we're not returning any output data but you might be thinking,

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.464
"What do you mean we're not returning output data?

00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:32.835
We've been printing out text this whole time."

00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:36.929
Well, when we view system.out.println to print text on our screen,

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:39.078
the printing is just for our eyes.

00:00:39.078 --> 00:00:42.240
Printing just displays text on a screen.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.100
It doesn't create any output that we can interact with later on in our programs.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.510
Printing and calculations are often done inside the body of a function definition,

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:55.229
different than a function that returns a final result to a program outside

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:59.032
of the definition like in a separate program where the function is called.

00:00:59.033 --> 00:01:01.710
So if you want to use the final calculation of a function

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.890
somewhere else besides inside the function definition code,

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.915
you need to tell your function to return the value of that calculation as an output,

00:01:09.915 --> 00:01:12.685
which means you have to change this return type void.

00:01:12.685 --> 00:01:14.625
Then when you call this function later on,

00:01:14.625 --> 00:01:16.530
you can actually use that return value.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.500
The return value can be any type of data we want.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.344
We just have to specify what kind by changing this word void.

00:01:23.344 --> 00:01:25.484
By replacing this word void with String,

00:01:25.484 --> 00:01:27.135
we can return a String value,

00:01:27.135 --> 00:01:28.710
not the same as printing it out.

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:31.154
If we change this return type to int,

00:01:31.155 --> 00:01:33.370
we can return an integer value.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.040
We can also return booleans,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.330
floats, and any type of data we've come across.

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:38.670
And when we return these values,

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.114
we can interact with them outside of our function definition.

00:01:42.114 --> 00:01:45.349
This will be easier to understand when we try this out in code next.
