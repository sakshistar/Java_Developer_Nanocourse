00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.865
Here's what your function definition should look like.

00:00:02.865 --> 00:00:05.365
It starts out with these words, public void,

00:00:05.365 --> 00:00:06.835
and then the name of our function,

00:00:06.835 --> 00:00:09.539
playMusic, with empty parentheses.

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:13.504
Then we have our decision making code inside our function's curly braces.

00:00:13.505 --> 00:00:16.844
We have an if statement that checks if the playButton is true.

00:00:16.844 --> 00:00:21.354
If it is true, we'll enter our if block of code and print out "Music is playing".

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:23.295
Otherwise, if playButton is false,

00:00:23.295 --> 00:00:25.215
we won't pass our if test condition,

00:00:25.214 --> 00:00:27.524
and we'll move down to our else block of code,

00:00:27.524 --> 00:00:30.269
and this will print out "Music is paused".

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.369
And that completes our playMusic function.
