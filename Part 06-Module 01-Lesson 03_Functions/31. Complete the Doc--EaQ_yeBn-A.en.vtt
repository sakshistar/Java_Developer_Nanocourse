00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.540
Here's the correct answer.

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.000
And the complete documentation for abs.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.039
You could have even look this up on Java's documentation web page.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:12.269
This documentation includes a general description of what this absolute value function

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.269
does and it includes a description of the return value, just like before.

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:20.269
But the previous documentation for abs was missing

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:25.269
this parameters section and that's an important part of this function.

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:27.439
Abs takes in one parameter an int,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.160
named a, that it calculates the absolute value of.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.549
So the correct answer is that

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:36.649
this documentation was missing a description of its parameter a,

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.652
and to include that in a Java doc comment it would look like this,

00:00:40.652 --> 00:00:42.945
an at symbol followed by param,

00:00:42.945 --> 00:00:44.490
then the name of that parameter,

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.260
which is just the letter A.

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:49.909
And then finally a description of that parameter.

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:52.709
Again, we already had a return value description so we

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.105
don't need to add this return part of the Java doc comment.

00:00:56.104 --> 00:00:59.459
And this last parameter comment line is incomplete,

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.500
because it doesn't include the name of that parameter, the name A.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.920
So @param a, the argument whose absolute value is to be determined,

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.170
is the correct answer.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.989
So if we include this parameter description line,

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:15.599
the complete Java doc comment that goes along with

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:19.109
this documentation looks like this: First,

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:22.799
a general description that tells us what the function abs does.

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.709
It returns the absolute value of a given int.

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:27.929
Next, are parameters.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.140
In this case there's one parameter, parameter A.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.805
And to describe that in a comment,

00:01:32.805 --> 00:01:35.645
we say @param a, then the description.

00:01:35.644 --> 00:01:37.609
And that was our correct answer.

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:41.789
And finally, we have our @return with the description of the return value.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.890
And with this complete documentation,

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.010
we can figure out how to use this abs function by putting in

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.180
a number and expecting a returned absolute value,

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.710
even though we haven't seen this function before.

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:55.279
And that's what's so cool about documentation.
