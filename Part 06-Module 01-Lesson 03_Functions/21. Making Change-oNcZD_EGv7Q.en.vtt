00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.084
Let's say you want to write a simple cashier program for a store.

00:00:04.084 --> 00:00:06.540
This program should automatically calculate and return

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.859
the correct change in dollars and cents to someone trying to make a purchase.

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:12.989
So say, they buy a bunch of bananas that cost $3.60

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.329
and then they hand our cashier program $5.75.

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:20.534
The program will calculate the correct change,

00:00:20.535 --> 00:00:24.940
which will be the difference between the provided dollars and the cost of the item.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.105
In this case, $2.15.

00:00:27.105 --> 00:00:30.074
And we want our program to return this value as output.

00:00:30.074 --> 00:00:33.234
To do this in code, write a function called makeChange,

00:00:33.234 --> 00:00:36.539
that should take in two parameters: the cost of an item,

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:38.310
like 3.60 for bananas,

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.755
and the dollars a person provides, like 5.75.

00:00:41.755 --> 00:00:43.940
And these are both double variable types.

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:46.394
Then this function should calculate the correct change,

00:00:46.395 --> 00:00:49.950
which will just be the dollars provided minus the cost of the item.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.929
And then finally, you want your function to return

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:55.019
this value and to return any data like change,

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.655
you'll have to do two things in your function definition.

00:00:57.655 --> 00:00:59.670
The first is to change the return type,

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.518
which has usually been void to the output type you expect to be returned,

00:01:03.518 --> 00:01:06.114
the output type of the calculated change.

00:01:06.114 --> 00:01:08.519
Second, you want to return the value of your data.

00:01:08.519 --> 00:01:12.079
The value of the calculated change in a return statement.

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:14.459
So go ahead and write the function makeChange.
