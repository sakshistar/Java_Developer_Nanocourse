00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.915
Parameters are useful for creating functions that react to unique input,

00:00:03.915 --> 00:00:05.759
like locations or someone's height.

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.140
And you can include any type and number of variables you want as parameters.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.810
Let's say a photographer has asked us to print out some photos for

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.859
them of a specific size and in either color or black and white.

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.359
We want clear printing instructions from them.

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.070
So, let's create a function that takes in three arguments,

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.609
two for the width and height of

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.869
a print and one telling us whether or not to print in color.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.000
Then it can tell us exactly what the print should look like.
