00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.544
Here's the correct code.

00:00:01.544 --> 00:00:05.639
We can change the range of our dice function just by changing the multiplier.

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:08.309
For six-sided dice, the multiplier was six

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.294
to give us a range one through six as an end results.

00:00:11.294 --> 00:00:13.664
For eight sides, we multiply it by eight.

00:00:13.664 --> 00:00:15.625
10 sides, we multiply it by 10.

00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:16.940
Do you see the pattern?

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.885
Our multiplier has always been equal to the number of sides our dice has.

00:00:20.885 --> 00:00:23.040
So we can just change this line of code to be

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.004
a random number equals random number times sides.

00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:27.884
The rest of our code will stay the same,

00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:31.230
so that when we shift our range up and convert to an integer,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.560
we'll get the range we want for any number of given sides a dice may have.
