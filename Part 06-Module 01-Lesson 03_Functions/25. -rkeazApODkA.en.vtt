00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
Our current rollDice function returns a random integer between one and six.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.830
But what if we wanted to change the range to be between one and

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.925
eight or one in 10 for eight and 10-sided dice?

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:15.053
We'd have to change the range of roll values that we output,

00:00:15.053 --> 00:00:18.280
and there are only two lines of code that control the range of a dice roll.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.750
There this multiplication line that controls how big our range is

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.890
and then this addition of one line of code that shifts our range up by one.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.464
To change this whole range so that it fits an eight-sided dice,

00:00:29.464 --> 00:00:32.780
we want the range to be from 1-8 instead of 1-6.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.480
And we can do this just by changing the multiplication line that controls how big

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:40.994
our range is by increasing the multiplier by two from 6-8.

00:00:40.994 --> 00:00:44.339
And to change the range from 1-10 for a 10 sided dice,

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.920
we'd multiply by 10 here.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.910
The plus one line of code stays the same because our lowest value roll or one,

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:53.959
stays the same no matter how many sides of dice has.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.740
So the multiplication line controls

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.070
our whole range and to get the correct range of roll values,

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.744
our random number is multiplied by the number of sides of dice has,

00:01:02.744 --> 00:01:04.259
whether that six, eight,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.000
10 are something else.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.936
So say, we have an input parameter inside's that tells us how many sides a dice has,

00:01:10.936 --> 00:01:13.305
eight, 10 or any other number of sides.

00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:16.740
Use this variable sides in this code so that it returns

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:20.129
the correct range of values no matter the number of sides a dice may have.
