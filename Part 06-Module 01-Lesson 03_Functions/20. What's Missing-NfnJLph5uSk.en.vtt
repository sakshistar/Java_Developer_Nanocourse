00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
This function has the wrong return type.

00:00:02.299 --> 00:00:05.654
The return type is void which means it's not returning any data at

00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:09.144
all and we want this to be retained as string passText.

00:00:09.144 --> 00:00:12.240
Even though we have a return statement at the end of our code,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.660
nothing will be returned without a return type that matches.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.940
Here's what the correct code looks like with

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.910
string as the return type since we are returning the string.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.350
For our first option,

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.650
we know that passText is a string.

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:26.639
We initialize it to one at the very beginning of

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.240
our code and the values it takes are surrounded by double quotes.

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:31.884
For our return statement,

00:00:31.885 --> 00:00:34.109
we have our return right at the end of our code that

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:37.229
returns the passText string, so this is correct.

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:39.269
It was just the wrong return type.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.530
Next let's see an example of returning numbers.
