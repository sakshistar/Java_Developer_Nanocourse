00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
Here's the correct function definition for make change.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.585
It takes in our two parameters,

00:00:04.585 --> 00:00:07.265
double itemCost and double dollarsProvided,

00:00:07.264 --> 00:00:10.515
and then inside the function it calculates the correct change.

00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:12.530
And change will also be a double.

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:16.280
And that's because it's the result of subtracting two other doubles.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.375
Then at the end, it has a return statement,

00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:21.179
that will return the value of change and it has

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:25.829
a matching return type that tells us that this function will be returning a double value.

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:27.179
Now if I call this function,

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.605
which I can do by saying something like make change and then passing in two values,

00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:34.424
this call will calculate the value of change.

00:00:34.424 --> 00:00:39.949
5.75 minus 3.60 and return that value as output.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.390
I can even assign the output of this function call

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.160
to a variable, like double returnedChange.

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:47.959
And then I can treat this as I would any other double.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.320
So returning output like this is a good way to get access to the result of a calculation.
