So far, we've seen how computers remember information and make decisions.

00:00:04.325 --> 00:00:08.685
But what if we've written some great program and want to reuse that same code later on.

00:00:08.685 --> 00:00:12.929
Like, what if we want to program repeating song lyrics to appear on a karaoke machine.

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.064
A karaoke machine displays the lyrics to songs as you sing along.

00:00:17.065 --> 00:00:21.670
So we want our karaoke program to print out the lyrics of the song we choose in sequence.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.720
Let's choose the song, Heart of Glass by Blondie and we'll

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:27.964
write a program to print out these lyrics on our karaoke screen.

00:00:27.964 --> 00:00:30.000
Let's get started.
