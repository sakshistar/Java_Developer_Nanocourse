00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.635
We've been using the function,

00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:04.014
Math.random, in our dice rolling program.

00:00:04.014 --> 00:00:07.544
And we know that random is a Math function that Java provides,

00:00:07.544 --> 00:00:11.120
that outputs a random double between 0 and 1.

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:15.480
But how did you know that this function would produce the 0-1 output?

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.890
We walked through how to use it together.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.880
And what about our println function that we've used a lot?

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:24.774
How would you have known how to print a line of text if we didn't go over it first?

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:28.769
You wouldn't have, and that's where documents come in useful.

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.670
You can find out more about any built-in Java functions like Math functions or

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.710
println functions just by looking at the available Java Documentation.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.134
Documentation is a fundamental feature of any big programming language.

00:00:42.134 --> 00:00:43.934
It's a huge resource for programmers,

00:00:43.935 --> 00:00:48.020
because good documentation provides all the information we need to know.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.930
It tells us about built- in functions as well as different variable types,

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:55.810
and shows us how to use these functions in our own programs.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.015
So programmers of all levels use documentation regularly.

00:01:00.015 --> 00:01:01.530
Java is owned by Oracle,

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.420
who maintains the most up to date Java documentation on their website.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.754
And I'll provide the link to the latest documentation page for Java in the notes below.

00:01:10.754 --> 00:01:16.000
Next, let's dive into some documentation and learn more about Math functions.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.799
To learn more about Math functions,

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.610
the first thing we need to do is search for the information we want.

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:23.129
Since we're interested in Math,

00:01:23.129 --> 00:01:29.390
let's search something like Math java 8 documentation.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.484
So we've specified what we're looking to learn more about Math,

00:01:33.484 --> 00:01:34.694
our version of Java,

00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:38.144
Java 8, and that we're looking for documentation.

00:01:38.144 --> 00:01:41.405
And any similar searches should work just as well.

00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:44.810
And our first page result looks promising.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.225
It's a docs.oracle.com page.

00:01:47.224 --> 00:01:50.119
So let's click on this.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.050
This takes us to the Math java documentation page.

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.769
So let's look at what this has in it.

00:01:56.769 --> 00:02:01.649
This will be the general structure for all of Oracle's documentation pages.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.626
First, we can see that it says Class Math.

00:02:04.626 --> 00:02:06.390
And the class is something that groups

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.740
together multiple functions and sometimes variables,

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.810
and it's why when we've used Math functions like random,

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.960
we've had to say Math.random in our function call and not just random by itself.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.295
This way, Java knows that this function can be found in the Math class.

00:02:23.294 --> 00:02:27.304
And we'll get into classes more later on when we talk about objects,

00:02:27.305 --> 00:02:30.180
so don't worry too much about this for now.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.105
Next, there's this general description of Math,

00:02:33.104 --> 00:02:36.389
and it tells us that the class Math contains methods,

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.839
and methods are the same thing as functions.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.080
So it says it contains methods or functions for

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.640
performing basic numeric operations like exponents,

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:50.339
logs, square roots, and trig functions.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.485
Cool. Then if we scroll down more,

00:02:52.485 --> 00:02:57.315
there's more description, and the next thing we see is a Field Summary.

00:02:57.314 --> 00:03:01.484
And a field is just a name for a variable that's part of a class,

00:03:01.485 --> 00:03:04.905
like how functions are part of the Math class.

00:03:04.905 --> 00:03:06.824
For functions in the Math class,

00:03:06.824 --> 00:03:10.079
we've had to say something like Math.random or

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.616
Math.whatever function name in order to call them,

00:03:13.616 --> 00:03:16.815
and these variables are accessed in the same way.

00:03:16.814 --> 00:03:20.534
So we can use the exact value of something like pi,

00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:22.375
which is around 3.14,

00:03:22.375 --> 00:03:25.814
by saying Math.pi in our programs.

00:03:25.814 --> 00:03:28.379
But don't worry too much about fields for now because we're

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.859
mainly interested in the functions that Java provides.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.170
The next section is called Method Summary,

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:37.729
and this is the section that we're most interested in.

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:42.604
This summary has a list of all the functions that Java provides.

00:03:42.604 --> 00:03:47.044
These are functions that we can use like Math.random and there are a lot.

00:03:47.044 --> 00:03:50.030
They're all listed in alphabetical order.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.895
Let's scroll down to the one we're interested in, random.

00:03:53.895 --> 00:03:56.620
Here's our familiar random function.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.575
It's listed in the method summary,

00:03:58.574 --> 00:04:01.339
and it contains a short description.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.705
This says, it returns a double value greater than or equal to zero and less than one.

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:09.960
And we can click on random for even more information.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:15.409
So, let's do that. Here's the documentation for the random function.

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:17.969
We see the start of its function definition,

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.765
public static double random with empty parentheses.

00:04:21.764 --> 00:04:23.899
Double is its return type,

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:27.104
and it means is returning a double as output.

00:04:27.105 --> 00:04:30.600
Then this page has a brief description of the entire function,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.820
and it tells you exactly what it does.

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:35.235
It tells you it returns a double value

00:04:35.235 --> 00:04:40.470
between 0 and 1 and it tells you a bit about how that value is chosen.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.720
It also has this return section that tells you

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.695
exactly what return value you should expect.

00:04:45.694 --> 00:04:51.165
A pseudorandom double greater than or equal to 0.0 And less than 1.0.

00:04:51.165 --> 00:04:53.625
So just by looking at this documentation,

00:04:53.625 --> 00:04:56.115
we can tell exactly what this function does,

00:04:56.115 --> 00:04:59.574
what it returns, and if it requires any input data.

00:04:59.574 --> 00:05:02.870
Next, we'll look at the documentation for a Math function that we

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.149
haven't seen and see if we can figure out what it does.
