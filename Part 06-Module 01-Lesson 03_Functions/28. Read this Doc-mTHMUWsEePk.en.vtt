00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.439
I called a Math.max with the arguments 20 and 15 put in,

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:06.324
we'll return the value 20, which is an int.

00:00:06.325 --> 00:00:10.725
From the general description of this function and the description of the return,

00:00:10.724 --> 00:00:14.250
we know from the documentation that this function is expected to

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.734
output the larger of its two input arguments.

00:00:18.734 --> 00:00:23.910
And in this case 20 is larger than 15 so we expect 20 to be returned.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.990
We also know that it returns an int because of its return type right here,

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:31.679
where it says public static int max so

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.399
even though this is the first time you've seen this function max in this course,

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.244
just by reading this documentation,

00:00:37.244 --> 00:00:40.890
you know how to use it and what to expect as output.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.075
You know how to use it,

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:43.725
what parameters it takes in,

00:00:43.725 --> 00:00:45.810
and what it returns.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.020
So documentation is really useful.
