Here's the documentation for a math function called Max,

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.620
that takes as input two int parameters, A and B.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.404
Read through this documentation,

00:00:09.404 --> 00:00:15.684
and then answer what will the function call Math.max of 20 and 15 output.

00:00:15.685 --> 00:00:18.195
Fill in the type of data it will output,

00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:19.620
whether that's a string, int,

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.310
float, etc., and the specific value of that output.
