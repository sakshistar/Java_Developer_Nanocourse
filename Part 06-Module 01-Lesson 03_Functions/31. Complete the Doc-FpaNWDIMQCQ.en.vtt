00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.325
Here's the incomplete documentation for a function called abs.

00:00:04.325 --> 00:00:06.615
Abs takes int, an integer parameter,

00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:10.054
and returns the absolute value of that number.

00:00:10.054 --> 00:00:11.919
Abs is just short for absolute,

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:13.724
and the absolute value of a number,

00:00:13.724 --> 00:00:16.804
is just that number as a positive value.

00:00:16.804 --> 00:00:20.314
So the absolute value of five would still be positive five,

00:00:20.315 --> 00:00:24.895
and the absolute value of negative five would also be positive five.

00:00:24.894 --> 00:00:27.695
So it just turns negative values positive.

00:00:27.695 --> 00:00:29.519
Read through this incomplete doc,

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.344
and see if you can figure out the piece that's missing.

00:00:32.344 --> 00:00:34.304
Then out of these three choices,

00:00:34.304 --> 00:00:39.000
select the corresponding Java doc component that could complete this documentation.
