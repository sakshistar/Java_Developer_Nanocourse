00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.475
Instead of programming in a karaoke machine,

00:00:02.475 --> 00:00:06.585
let's write code that let's you listen to the music you want on a music player.

00:00:06.585 --> 00:00:11.324
You'll define a function called playMusic that let's a user play or pause a song.

00:00:11.324 --> 00:00:14.699
This is like on a phone or music player where there's a play button.

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:16.410
For a typical device,

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.765
the music plays when the play button has been pressed

00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:22.109
and pauses when it hasn't been pressed or when it's been released.

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.780
So let's say you have access to a boolean variable named

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.060
playButton and this needs to be set equal to either true or false.

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:32.210
It should be true when the play button is pressed and music is playing,

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.115
and it should be false when the button is released and when the music is paused.

00:00:36.115 --> 00:00:40.215
And this variable will be declared outside of your playMusic function.

00:00:40.215 --> 00:00:41.595
So using this variable,

00:00:41.594 --> 00:00:44.894
write a function definition for playMusic, that'll print out,

00:00:44.895 --> 00:00:47.730
Music is playing, when play button is equal to true,

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:49.310
and otherwise prints out,

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.000
Music is paused, when play button equals false.
