00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
For the functions we've used,

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.859
we haven't needed to know about the code inside the functions.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.195
For Math.random and Math.max,

00:00:07.195 --> 00:00:10.330
we aren't exactly sure how Java calculates a random value,

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.669
or it chooses a max out of two numbers.

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:14.949
We've treated these functions as black boxes,

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:17.454
and only needed to know what the functions do,

00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:18.954
what parameters they have,

00:00:18.954 --> 00:00:20.829
and what data they return.

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:24.469
We only needed to read the documentation to be able to use these functions.

00:00:24.469 --> 00:00:27.449
These documents are a summary of what a function does,

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.024
and it's a good idea to include them in your own code.

00:00:30.024 --> 00:00:33.100
Especially, if you want to share your code with other programmers.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.079
Or even if you're writing a lot of code and

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.765
making a note to yourself about what a function does.

00:00:37.765 --> 00:00:40.280
So, let's see how to create your own Java documentation.
