00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.514
For a karaoke machine,

00:00:01.514 --> 00:00:04.049
we now have a completed course function definition

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.609
that contains code to print out the course to heart of glass.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.345
But how can we actually use this?

00:00:09.345 --> 00:00:12.240
To actually use a function inside a program and

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.300
prompt this whole block of code to run, we have to call it.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.734
And the function call,

00:00:16.734 --> 00:00:19.220
just means we refer to that function by it's name.

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:20.279
In this case, chorus,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.095
with empty parentheses, and we follow that by a semi-colon.

00:00:24.094 --> 00:00:27.289
And this looks sort of like a call to the println function.

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.629
Only println was attached to our System.out screen output,

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:34.729
and most of the functions we define in this lesson will stand on their own.

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:37.649
So calling this function prompts the set of code contained

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.650
in our chorus function definition to run.

00:00:40.651 --> 00:00:44.420
In this call, we'll print out the four lines of the chorus that we expect.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.625
It's important to note that calling and defining a function are done separately.

00:00:48.625 --> 00:00:52.530
Our function definition for chorus has all this information like the return type,

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.149
and name, and all the specific code that the function contains.

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:57.839
But to actually run this code,

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.460
we have to call the function separate from this definition.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.409
This is sort of like the difference between definitions of words in

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.250
a dictionary and actually using those words in a sentence.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.620
When we need to learn about a word and what it means,

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.859
we can look it up in a dictionary.

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:16.775
We can learn details like how the word is used in a sentence and how it's pronounced.

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:19.830
But then when we actually use the word in a sentence,

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:21.804
we don't include a whole definition,

00:01:21.805 --> 00:01:24.570
we just refer to that word in a separate text.

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:27.419
And so the dictionary is like a function definition which

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.314
gives us the details of what our function does and how it can be used.

00:01:31.314 --> 00:01:33.719
It shows us the code that our function contains

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:36.784
and tells us if it's accessible or if it returns any data.

00:01:36.784 --> 00:01:38.549
But to actually use and execute

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.994
a function's code in a separate program, we have to call it.

00:01:41.995 --> 00:01:43.755
We don't include the whole definition,

00:01:43.754 --> 00:01:45.629
we just refer to it by name.

00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:47.864
So definitions describe a function,

00:01:47.864 --> 00:01:49.334
show us it's internal code,

00:01:49.334 --> 00:01:51.367
and let us know how to use it.

00:01:51.367 --> 00:01:54.709
And calling a function is referring to that function by name.

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:57.212
And we only have to define a function once,

00:01:57.212 --> 00:02:00.539
we can call that function as many times as you like.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.000
So now we have a function that prints out our chorus,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.543
and we can call it and get this output,

00:02:05.543 --> 00:02:07.275
and we can call it repeatedly.

00:02:07.275 --> 00:02:09.314
Let's call it twice in a row.

00:02:09.314 --> 00:02:11.159
Now our chorus will print out twice,

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:12.655
and it's easy to repeat.

00:02:12.655 --> 00:02:14.280
And now if you want to change something about

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.759
our chorus code like changing the spelling or punctuation,

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:20.579
we can change it inside our function definition.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.635
And when we run this code multiple times,

00:02:22.634 --> 00:02:24.429
the output will change as well,

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.469
but we're only here to change our one line of code inside our function definition.

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:31.439
Now let's get some practice defining and calling functions of our own.
