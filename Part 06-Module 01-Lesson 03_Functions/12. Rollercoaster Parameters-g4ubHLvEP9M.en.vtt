00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.279
Here's the correct parameter, double, height.

00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:07.064
We know that the parameter name that this function is expecting is called height.

00:00:07.065 --> 00:00:08.609
And that's because that's the name of

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:11.464
the variable that we check in our if test condition.

00:00:11.464 --> 00:00:16.259
And we also know that since a 130.5 is a valid argument value for height,

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.090
that this can't be an integer.

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:19.699
Integers are only whole numbers.

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:21.059
So, this has to be a double.

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:23.234
Which allows for a decimal point values.

00:00:23.234 --> 00:00:25.484
And by requiring this height parameter,

00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:26.849
this function can now check

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.030
people's unique heights and tell them whether or not they passed the requirements.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.039
And we can include as many parameters in our function definition as we want.

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:38.000
Next, let's see how to include multiple parameters.
