00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520
We know that functions are useful for grouping code together,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.439
and that we can execute that code just by referring to the function name.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.435
And functions only have to be written one time,

00:00:10.435 --> 00:00:14.250
so no copy and pasting lots of code when you want to repeat it.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.125
For the following scenarios,

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:18.809
check which ones would be helped if you organized your code

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:21.974
into functions instead of leaving them as blocks of code.

00:00:21.975 --> 00:00:26.115
In scenario one, you've written a block of code that adds two numbers together,

00:00:26.114 --> 00:00:30.384
and you want to use it repeatedly to calculate your expenses over some time.

00:00:30.385 --> 00:00:31.920
In the second scenario,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.054
a friend wants to share their restaurant rating code with you.

00:00:35.054 --> 00:00:38.835
And in the third, you've written a block of code that sets a wake-up alarm,

00:00:38.835 --> 00:00:41.115
and you use it in all your clocks at home.

00:00:41.115 --> 00:00:45.135
But you made a mistake inside the code and need to fix it for all the clocks.

00:00:45.134 --> 00:00:46.890
So for all these scenarios,

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.000
check any one of them that could be helped by using functions.
