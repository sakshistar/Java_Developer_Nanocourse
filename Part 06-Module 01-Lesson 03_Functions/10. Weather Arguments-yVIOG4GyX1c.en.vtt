00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.655
For both of these, we're calling weatherInterpreter with some int argument put in.

00:00:04.655 --> 00:00:07.780
In the first case, if we have four as an input,

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.480
our temperature will be set to that value of four.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.685
Then Java will enter our function code,

00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:14.500
and read it line by line.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.939
First comes our if statement,

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:18.655
and it checks if temperature is greater than 30.

00:00:18.655 --> 00:00:20.269
Four is less than 30,

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:21.425
so this will be false,

00:00:21.425 --> 00:00:23.330
and we'll move on to or else if.

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:25.524
Then it checks if temperature is less than five.

00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:27.329
Four is less than five,

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.109
so this condition is true,

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.140
and we'll enter this statement and print out brr,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.039
consider wearing a jacket.

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:37.433
In our second call, we're passing in 32,

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:40.320
so our temperature parameter will be set to 32,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.329
and again will read our code line by line.

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.814
First we see our if, and check if temperature is greater than 30.

00:00:46.814 --> 00:00:48.689
32 is greater than 30,

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:50.399
so this time this is true,

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.179
and we'll print out, it's hot outside.

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:57.604
So even though we're using the same code for different arguments like four and 32,

00:00:57.604 --> 00:01:00.269
this can result in different lines being printed out.
