00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.024
Here's a function called admission,

00:00:02.024 --> 00:00:04.759
that tells people if they're eligible to ride a roller coaster.

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.865
To ride, a person has to be taller than 120 centimeters,

00:00:08.865 --> 00:00:12.044
about four feet and if they fall above that range,

00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:14.969
then this prints out, you pass the height requirements.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.115
Otherwise, it prints out,

00:00:16.114 --> 00:00:17.804
sorry you do not pass.

00:00:17.804 --> 00:00:21.484
This function requires that a person input their height in centimeters.

00:00:21.484 --> 00:00:24.960
In admission, with an argument value of hundred thirty point five,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.429
is a valid function call.

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:27.731
So knowing all this,

00:00:27.731 --> 00:00:31.199
fill in the type and name of the parameter that this function expects.
