00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.084
Here's a function weatherInterpreter,

00:00:02.084 --> 00:00:04.365
that prints out a message when it's hot, or cold,

00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:08.144
or in between, depending on the value of the parameter temperature,

00:00:08.144 --> 00:00:11.224
which is an int variable in degree Celsius.

00:00:11.224 --> 00:00:15.279
It prints out a hot message when the temperature is above 30 degrees Celsius,

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:17.544
which is about 85 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:00:17.545 --> 00:00:20.845
And a cold message from when it's below five degrees Celsius,

00:00:20.844 --> 00:00:23.140
which is about 40 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.144
Otherwise, it considers this neutral weather and prints out not too hot, not too cold.

00:00:28.144 --> 00:00:32.008
What will this print out if we call weatherInterpreter with an argument value of

00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:37.000
four and what will it print out if we change the argument value to 32?
