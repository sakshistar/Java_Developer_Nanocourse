00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
All three of these scenarios could be helped by

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.089
using functions instead of just blocks of code.

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:07.609
Functions let you easily reuse code.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.574
So if you put this block of addition code into one big addition function,

00:00:11.574 --> 00:00:14.949
you could use it over and over again to add up your expenses.

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:19.839
Functions also organize and group together lines of code to perform a specific task,

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:21.475
like rating a restaurant.

00:00:21.475 --> 00:00:23.845
So without knowing the details of your friends code,

00:00:23.844 --> 00:00:25.629
they could share it with you and you can use

00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:27.747
it by referring to the name of their function,

00:00:27.748 --> 00:00:29.745
similar to how we use println.

00:00:29.745 --> 00:00:33.140
Lastly, functions make code more maintainable.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.024
So in this case, if you organize this code into one alarm function,

00:00:37.024 --> 00:00:39.784
you would just need to change the mistake in one place,

00:00:39.784 --> 00:00:44.000
in the one function and not in all the separate clocks it's been used in.
