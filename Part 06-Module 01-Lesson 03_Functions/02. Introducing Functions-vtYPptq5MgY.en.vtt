00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
So here are some of the Blondie lyrics we want to display.

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.820
We can see that it starts out with the chorus.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.620
Once I had a love and it was a gas,

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.814
soon found out had a heart of glass.

00:00:09.814 --> 00:00:14.989
Seemed like the real thing only to find mucho mistrust, love's gone behind.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.390
And then these same lines are repeated later on in the song.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.553
And to display these lyrics on a karaoke machine,

00:00:21.553 --> 00:00:24.905
we can write out a block of code to print this chorus and other lyrics.

00:00:24.905 --> 00:00:30.315
And for a chorus, we can copy and paste the same code again wherever the chorus appears.

00:00:30.315 --> 00:00:34.310
But repeating the same code again like this should be avoided.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.585
For example, what if we wrote chorus code with a small spelling error.

00:00:37.585 --> 00:00:40.207
We wrote live instead of love,

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:43.274
and we found this error only after we'd copy and pasted it.

00:00:43.274 --> 00:00:45.195
When we did find the small error,

00:00:45.195 --> 00:00:47.954
we'd have to check all the places or course code appears

00:00:47.954 --> 00:00:51.929
and go to each place and change the blocks of code individually.

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:53.429
This isn't too bad for two copies of

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:56.909
the same thing but it could get out of hand very quickly,

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:59.764
and it can be a lot of work for one small change.

00:00:59.765 --> 00:01:01.619
Wouldn't it be useful to group our course code

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:04.564
together so that we can reuse it and change it easily?

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:09.539
Well, we can. Java let's us group code together in something called a function.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.310
Functions hold all the instructions and

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.015
decision making that's performed in a specific task.

00:01:14.015 --> 00:01:16.400
Even something like printing out a chorus in a song.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.250
So we can group these four lines of code together in one function and

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.549
any changes we make in that function will effect everywhere that it's used automatically.

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.000
In this lesson, we'll will learn all about functions and how to create our own.
