After success with printing photos,

00:00:02.279 --> 00:00:05.490
we've built a program that let's people share their photos online.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.130
And we've created a function that let's people interact with

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.750
shared photos by commenting on and liking individual photos.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.429
This function likePhoto,

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.515
takes in three parameters: an int that holds the current number of likes a photo has,

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:22.649
a string that holds a person's comment and

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:26.445
a boolean that will be true if a person likes a photo and false if they don't.

00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:28.530
It will then print out the comment as

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.060
feedback and increase the number of likes if boolean like is true.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.515
Write down a valid function call for this function.

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:41.000
Remember that this expects these three parameters to be provided in a function call.
