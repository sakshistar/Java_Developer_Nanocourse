00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
Here's the correct solution.

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.065
After public comes a return type,

00:00:04.065 --> 00:00:05.250
which is something like void,

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.439
then comes our function name,

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.509
which we can later use to call the function.

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:11.484
This is something like print line.

00:00:11.484 --> 00:00:14.004
Then finally our block of code inside the function,

00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:16.400
which it will execute when it's called.

00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:19.000
Now let's fill in these blanks by writing our own function.
