00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
Every function call looks like this.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.299
It's just the name of the function,

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:06.434
followed by the arguments it expects,

00:00:06.434 --> 00:00:08.809
and it finishes with a semi-colon.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.845
Here's an example of a valid function call for likePhoto.

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:14.894
It first expects an int argument,

00:00:14.894 --> 00:00:16.259
followed by a string,

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.825
followed by a boolean in that order.

00:00:18.824 --> 00:00:22.739
And so, any function call that looks like this will be valid.

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:26.989
This particular function call will set the currentLikes to be 10.

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:29.504
The comment will just be great photo,

00:00:29.504 --> 00:00:31.739
and the boolean like will be set to true.

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:33.854
So, our current likes would increase.

00:00:33.854 --> 00:00:36.434
If the order of these arguments were switched,

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:38.130
or we were missing an argument,

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.054
this would create an error.

00:00:40.054 --> 00:00:44.310
So, it's always important to match up parameters with arguments.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.385
So, for functions that expect parameters is input,

00:00:47.384 --> 00:00:52.000
the order and type of arguments you put in in a function call is really important.
