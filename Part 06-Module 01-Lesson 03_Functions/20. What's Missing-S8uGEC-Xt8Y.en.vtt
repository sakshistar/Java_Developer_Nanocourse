00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
Here's our function admission again that tells people

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.060
whether or not they pass their requirements to ride a roller coaster.

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:08.250
But the code is a little bit changed.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.820
It still requires that a person input their height so that they can test it.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.214
And then this function will return a string passText

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:17.550
that tells them whether they pass or don't pass.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.810
In our previous example,

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:22.009
the string was printed out using print lines inside our function.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.135
But this time, we're returning an output,

00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:28.859
this passText string, and nothing will print out when we call this function.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.750
Notice the inner if and else statements,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.225
the passText string takes on a different value,

00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:36.515
and we only return its value at the very end of our program.

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:39.570
Return statements like this one end a function call,

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.219
and so they always have to go below any code that we want to execute.

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.104
So this code is almost finished,

00:00:45.104 --> 00:00:47.279
but it won't actually return the string we want.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.920
Something is incomplete or missing.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.310
Can you identify the problem out of the following four options?

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.094
passText isn't a string variable,

00:00:56.094 --> 00:00:57.710
we have the wrong return type,

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.280
a wrong return statement,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.000
or nothing is wrong at all.
