00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.339
Now we've practiced making functions that can do three main things.

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:06.125
One, they work is a black box,

00:00:06.125 --> 00:00:08.779
which means that they contain and execute multiple lines of

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:11.924
code without you having to know what that code is.

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:15.925
Two, they can take in data as arguments and work with that data.

00:00:15.925 --> 00:00:18.410
And three, they can return data and then

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.019
their output can be treated just like you would treat any other variable.

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:24.530
And the black box is often what makes functions so

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.580
powerful because without having to know all the code inside a function,

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.309
you employ all its code just by calling the function by

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:34.579
name and giving it any parameters that it requires.

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.559
This is especially useful whenever you want to use

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.230
functions that someone else has written.

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:42.349
Hey Suzanne, I overheard you talk about black boxes.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.295
Look what I've built here.

00:00:44.295 --> 00:00:45.170
Cool. What does it do?

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.730
Well, all you need to know is that it takes bread as an input.

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:52.039
I happen to have some bread right here.

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:52.780
Perfect.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.515
Okay. I'll try it out.

00:00:55.515 --> 00:01:00.804
All right. Now we just wait to see the result.

00:01:00.804 --> 00:01:06.859
And here we go.

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:08.620
Oh cool it makes a sandwich.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.490
Yup. All the details about how

00:01:10.489 --> 00:01:13.129
the black box actually makes the sandwich is not important.

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:15.509
All you need to know is that it takes bread as an input.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.440
That's kind of like the functions we've been using.

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:19.685
We've been using functions like math functions

00:01:19.685 --> 00:01:22.454
and println without having to know their inner workings.

00:01:22.454 --> 00:01:24.980
Yeah, but how do you know what input each function needs?

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.980
Like strings for print line function.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.905
Well, just like you told me to put bread inside this,

00:01:29.905 --> 00:01:32.900
Java will tell us if functions require certain parameters as

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.335
input and this information is actually contained in Java documents,

00:01:36.334 --> 00:01:38.000
which we'll learn all about next.
