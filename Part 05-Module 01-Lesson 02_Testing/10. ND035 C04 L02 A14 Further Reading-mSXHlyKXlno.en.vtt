00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.615
The next part is just a little bit of further reading.

00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:08.355
It will be a good idea for you to write or look into the exceptions.

00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:11.220
There are tons of documentation available on

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.070
the Internet about how to write great two unit tests,

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.500
that will be also something that you can take a look at,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.929
Advanced Mockito, Power MOCK.

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:23.910
These are some very good concepts that might help you write better unit tests.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.719
One more thing that you can read about is TestNG.

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:30.059
Now, that is another alternative test framework

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:33.000
that you can use to write your unit tests.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.890
It's similar to JUnit,

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.120
and I hope that you experiment a little with that as well. That's all for today.
