00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.424
Let's look at the next part of this video which is Mocks.

00:00:04.424 --> 00:00:07.814
Now in order to effectively isolate the code we want to test,

00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:12.839
sometimes it's necessary to pre-set up or entirely remove some parts of

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:18.509
the code to create the right conditions and not to let other bugs affect tests.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.825
Now what I'm going to do is I am going to give you a short example of what this means.

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:27.599
So if you remember that e-commerce application,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.210
we had a method called getUsers.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.005
Now the getUsers fetches the User deal,

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:38.370
and that is fetched from the UserRepository, from the database.

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:41.989
Now, it might be unnecessary to

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.234
really make a connection to the database in order to fetch the user.

00:00:46.234 --> 00:00:52.070
In that case, what we do is we stub or substitute

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.545
the user repository with the mock object or something that is alike,

00:00:58.545 --> 00:01:04.689
the UseRepository object and that is Mocks, that is stubbing.
