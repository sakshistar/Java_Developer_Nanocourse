00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.695
Now, let's look at a few annotations from JUnit suite.

00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:09.855
I don't know what versions of JUnit you have downloaded.

00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:11.925
This applies to JUnit 5,

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:13.245
since that's the latest.

00:00:13.244 --> 00:00:18.314
I would use or at least experiment with runways.

00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:24.645
This is one of the annotations that will help us identify the parent of the suite,

00:00:24.644 --> 00:00:29.714
and the second would be select classes.

00:00:29.714 --> 00:00:35.280
As you may have guessed from the name that what this does is,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.234
it just helps you identify all the classes that you would put under that suite.

00:00:41.234 --> 00:00:44.350
For example here, I mean,

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.689
you would move this into a different class and you would do that.

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:51.619
But I want to you to take a look at this and try to do this by

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:56.945
yourself so that you can get familiar with this.

00:00:56.945 --> 00:00:59.000
So this is how it's going to look.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.500
So you add all the classes,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.560
the test classes that fall under this suite.
