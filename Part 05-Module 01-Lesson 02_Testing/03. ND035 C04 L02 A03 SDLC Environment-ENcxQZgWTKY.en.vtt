00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.379
The next part that I'm going to talk about is environments.

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:06.915
What I mean by this is that,

00:00:06.915 --> 00:00:09.179
when you develop your project,

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.044
you would not go ahead and deploy

00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:15.884
the develop solution into the production environment directly.

00:00:15.884 --> 00:00:19.440
What the production environment means is,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.060
let's say that you go www.udacity.com.

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:33.000
This is a site which is available to the public and the accounts that are created under

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.490
a production environment would usually have the real user

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:44.285
accounts and it's a live environment where the actual user traffic is served from.

00:00:44.284 --> 00:00:51.929
So if you hit google.com or any other sites which are available to you,

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:53.945
this is the environment that you'll hit.

00:00:53.945 --> 00:00:57.274
But this is not the environment where you do all your development.

00:00:57.274 --> 00:00:59.659
Can you imagine doing the development

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.284
in the production environment which is the final environment?

00:01:02.284 --> 00:01:06.098
So that the actual traffic gets impacted,

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:11.000
if it's not thoroughly tested there is no guarantee

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.575
that the users will be affected by this.

00:01:16.575 --> 00:01:20.390
So there is an alternate environment that developers

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.650
use in order to test the application or the code.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.375
This is not only used by developers but it's also used by testers,

00:01:29.375 --> 00:01:32.584
the product team, the business team.

00:01:32.584 --> 00:01:38.804
Usually you're given a requirement against which you run tests in this environment.

00:01:38.805 --> 00:01:41.915
Your server LB or low balancer could look like

00:01:41.915 --> 00:01:45.050
test.udacity.com and the accounts

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.539
associated with this environment would usually be test accounts.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.790
A non prod environment,

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.115
let's call it non-production environment.

00:01:56.114 --> 00:02:00.034
A non-production environment could be a high availability environment.

00:02:00.034 --> 00:02:03.289
It could be a dev environment or the development environment,

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.440
it could be a quality assurance environment.

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.099
There are some companies that call it stage as well.

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.960
So these are the terms that you should be familiar with when you are interviewing for

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.515
a position where they may ask about the environment information if you have any.

00:02:21.514 --> 00:02:22.894
So yes.

00:02:22.895 --> 00:02:28.390
So in terms of sequence usually the code is deployed in the dev environment,

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:31.564
then it moves to a test environment.

00:02:31.564 --> 00:02:33.710
It could be HA high availability,

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.555
QA quality assurance or stage environment where regressions are run,

00:02:38.555 --> 00:02:40.625
we'll come to that later on.

00:02:40.625 --> 00:02:43.925
Then if the code is seen to meet

00:02:43.925 --> 00:02:48.755
all the requirements it's moved to the production environment which is here.

00:02:48.754 --> 00:02:53.269
Sometimes you could also move it into a prod like environment

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.920
or a production like environment and then move it to the production environment.

00:02:57.919 --> 00:02:59.644
So it's a free form,

00:02:59.645 --> 00:03:02.645
you may have different environments depending on

00:03:02.645 --> 00:03:08.340
the amount of tests that your company decides to run.
