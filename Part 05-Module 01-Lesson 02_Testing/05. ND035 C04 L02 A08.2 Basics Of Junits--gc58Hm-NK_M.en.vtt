00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.665
Let's go ahead and write JUnits for all the helper methods that we take a look at.

00:00:04.665 --> 00:00:08.429
So we looked at the test example,

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.740
which is what we had,

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.570
and we now are going to write test for this helper class.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.030
So the first and foremost thing that you would do

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.670
at this point in time is go to your POM.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.250
We only have the JUnits.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.204
But since we would also be using Mockito,

00:00:26.204 --> 00:00:29.219
we are going to add one more dependency.

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:35.259
So why don't you go ahead and look for the Mockito Maven dependency.
