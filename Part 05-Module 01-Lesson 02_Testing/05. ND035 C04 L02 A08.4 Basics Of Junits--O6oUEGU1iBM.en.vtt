00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.690
Now, let's play around a little more with this test that we have written over here.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.214
Let's change this to string and try to learn this.

00:00:07.214 --> 00:00:09.300
I'm going to fix this to three.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.210
So earlier when we ran this, if you remember,

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.585
it gave a green signal which was a test.

00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:19.750
Now let's try to run it again and see what happens.

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.079
Okay. First said there is no return statement.

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.599
Let me just return this and rerun it.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.135
Okay. So let's read this.

00:00:33.134 --> 00:00:35.640
It says method tests must be void.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.134
So that's one of the primary conditions that this needs to be void.

00:00:39.134 --> 00:00:40.629
Let's do one more thing.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.050
Let's change it to a private method and see what happens now.

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:47.509
As you see it's already turned gray,

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:48.994
which means it's never used.

00:00:48.994 --> 00:00:50.929
Why does it do that?

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:52.914
We'll find out right now.

00:00:52.914 --> 00:00:55.289
Okay. It says it's incompatible types.

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.174
First of all, let me remove this and rerun this.

00:00:59.174 --> 00:01:04.399
Okay. The second thing it says is that the test method should be public.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.365
So we just learned two primary things that we need to keep in mind why do I need test.

00:01:09.364 --> 00:01:14.099
First, they need to be void and second they need to be public.
