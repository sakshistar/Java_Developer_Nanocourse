00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.509
Look at the definition of testing now.

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:05.354
What does testing mean?

00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:10.905
It's nothing but verification of the functionality of your application.

00:00:10.904 --> 00:00:15.285
So we just make sure that all the parts that you have developed,

00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:18.750
they worked together exactly as they should.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:26.535
It also helps us with ensuring that the application is bug-free or defect free.

00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:31.365
These are the terminologies that you hear used alternatively.

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:37.484
So it involves executing a software component or test on a software component,

00:00:37.484 --> 00:00:41.634
and running the test on software component,

00:00:41.634 --> 00:00:45.274
and coming up with results of the tests.

00:00:45.274 --> 00:00:49.530
It could be either a failure or a success.
