00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.549
This is a picture of

00:00:02.549 --> 00:00:05.910
the systems development life cycle or a software development life cycle.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.794
The first part includes analysis.

00:00:09.794 --> 00:00:11.789
What I mean by this is,

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:13.879
in an engineering setup,

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.795
you have your product team,

00:00:15.794 --> 00:00:17.730
or you may not have a product team,

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.385
you may have an engineering project manager

00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:22.695
who might be able to give you the requirements.

00:00:22.695 --> 00:00:25.785
What they do is they want an analysis.

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:30.574
They want some statistics to see what is the shortcoming in your project,

00:00:30.574 --> 00:00:34.429
and that is what comes as a requirement to you,

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:36.784
which is what analysis does.

00:00:36.784 --> 00:00:38.869
The second phase is the design.

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:40.934
Once you are given the requirement,

00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:50.195
you as a developer come with a solution of designing the solution for the requirement.

00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:53.494
That is what we do in the design phase.

00:00:53.494 --> 00:00:57.530
You might take help from the other engineers or

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.575
your leads to find out how to design the solution for this requirement.

00:01:03.575 --> 00:01:07.219
Then you get into the development phase,

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:11.510
which is what you have learned so far in this course.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.430
In the development phase,

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.365
you would write the code,

00:01:15.364 --> 00:01:21.280
and you would manually probably test out the requirements solution,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.835
but that is where testing comes into picture.

00:01:25.834 --> 00:01:30.019
This is where you would write tests to ensure that you don't have to

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:34.295
manually test the developed code again.

00:01:34.295 --> 00:01:36.795
The next part is the implementation,

00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:41.000
then you go with documentation, and evaluation.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.609
The cycle for software development

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:48.159
continues so that the product develops into a very mature product,

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.414
and eventually goes to production,

00:01:50.415 --> 00:01:53.984
or however, you use an application.

00:01:53.984 --> 00:01:56.108
With this in mind,

00:01:56.108 --> 00:01:58.699
there are certain other documents or

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.579
resources that are going to be linked to the video which

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:07.859
you can go through if you have more interest in learning more about the SDLC life cycle.
