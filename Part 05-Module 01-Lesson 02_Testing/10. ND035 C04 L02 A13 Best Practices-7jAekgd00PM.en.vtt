00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
Now, that you understand JUnit, and mocks,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.325
and stubbing more clearly,

00:00:05.325 --> 00:00:09.120
let's look into a few good practices.

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.924
So here are the best practices.

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:16.380
The first thing that we kept discussing through the tutorial was readability.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.774
By readability, I mean,

00:00:17.774 --> 00:00:21.404
readability of the test case or the test method.

00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:27.539
The second one that I would like you to focus is on real logic-failure tests.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.079
There is no point in writing a lot of tests that don't do anything.

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.809
A lot of people or developers are

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.765
seen to write a lot of tests that don't really mean much.

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:38.355
A lot of times, they test,

00:00:38.354 --> 00:00:42.599
they end up writing tests for framework's functionalities,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.484
and that is not required because frameworks like spring and

00:00:45.484 --> 00:00:49.100
others that are developed are thoroughly tested already.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.570
So you should try to completely remove the framework or

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:00.875
configuration part from the actual test which is the functionality of your tests.

00:01:00.875 --> 00:01:05.750
One of the great things that you could do is write unit tests

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.625
for one code at a time and avoid unnecessary assertions.

00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:15.079
You should always keep them independent and not have

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:21.655
one test rely on another or have very much dependency on each other.

00:01:21.655 --> 00:01:23.909
Another thing that you should do is,

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.265
you should mock out all external services and states because that helps you

00:01:28.265 --> 00:01:30.650
reduce the amount of time it takes for test to

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.925
run and still test the functionality of your code.

00:01:33.924 --> 00:01:35.879
Like I had already mentioned,

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:38.060
don't unit-test configuration settings

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.310
because they're not really required most of the time.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.540
But if they are required,

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.650
make sure that you add them.
