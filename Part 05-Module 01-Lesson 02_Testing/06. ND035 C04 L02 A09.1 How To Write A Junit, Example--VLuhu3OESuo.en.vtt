00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
If you weren't able to write at least one test case so far,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.330
by taking an example from the previous test case we covered so far,

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.370
then you are doing a good job already.

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:09.839
If you haven't in more than one,

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:11.789
then you're doing an excellent job.

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:16.140
I'm going to now discuss a few more advanced features of Junit,

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.330
that will take you from a beginner's level,

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:20.039
to the next intermediary level.

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.910
Let's take a look at this site.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.620
This is the official site for Junits,

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.615
and I have it open here.

00:00:26.614 --> 00:00:29.989
So on this side, we get a comprehensive list of

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:34.100
all the methods that the Junit assert class contains,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.410
and you can go into the details and read what each of these methods do for you.

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:44.659
This will help you to find the methods that you can use,

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:49.099
or keep these methods in mind so that next time you're trying to write a Junit,

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.579
you know which methods you're going to call in advance.
