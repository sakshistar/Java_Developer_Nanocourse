00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.919
Welcome to Lesson 3, NoSQL and MongoDB.

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:07.290
In this lesson, we'll be talking about

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.910
non-relational databases also known as NoSQL databases.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.615
We already looked at relational databases where data is

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:20.009
organized into tables containing rows and columns.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.260
The tables adhere to a schema,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.660
a database consists of a set of tables,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.940
and these tables can be related.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.330
The power of relational database lies in the fact that

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.659
data can be distributed across multiple tables,

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:37.639
but can be merged together using joints.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.134
Non-relational databases on the other hand,

00:00:41.134 --> 00:00:45.155
do not generally organize data as rows and columns.

00:00:45.155 --> 00:00:47.329
Depending on the database you choose,

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.299
relations might not be possible either.

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:52.144
As the name signifies,

00:00:52.145 --> 00:00:55.550
SQL is not the interface to these databases.

00:00:55.549 --> 00:01:00.829
NoSQL databases also did not enforce a strict schema definition.

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.884
NoSQL databases can be broadly classified into four categories.

00:01:05.885 --> 00:01:08.615
First, key-value stores.

00:01:08.614 --> 00:01:12.574
This is a hash table with keys and values.

00:01:12.575 --> 00:01:18.109
Every item in the database is stored as an attribute name together with its value.

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:21.769
Riak and Redis are good examples of this type.

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:24.554
Next, is document stores.

00:01:24.555 --> 00:01:30.485
These databases pair each key with a complex data structure known as a document.

00:01:30.484 --> 00:01:34.114
Document can contain many different key value pairs

00:01:34.114 --> 00:01:38.114
or key RA pairs or even nested documents.

00:01:38.114 --> 00:01:42.140
MongoDB is the most popular of these databases.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.125
Next, column-based stores.

00:01:45.125 --> 00:01:49.670
These stores store data together as columns instead of

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.454
rows and are optimized for queries over large datasets.

00:01:54.454 --> 00:01:58.894
The most popular are Cassandra and HBase.

00:01:58.894 --> 00:02:01.909
Finally, graph-based.

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:08.465
A network database that uses edges and nodes to represent and store data.

00:02:08.465 --> 00:02:12.500
Neo4J is a good example of this type.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.699
In this lesson, we'll be focusing on MongoDB,

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:22.534
a popular and widely used document-oriented distributed database.

00:02:22.534 --> 00:02:26.914
First, you will install and set up MongoDB.

00:02:26.914 --> 00:02:34.259
Next, you'll do basic operations on MongoDB documents using the interactive Mongo shell.

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:39.454
Finally, you will learn how to model your data as documents.

00:02:39.455 --> 00:02:41.360
This lesson's going to be great.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.000
Good luck and have fun.
