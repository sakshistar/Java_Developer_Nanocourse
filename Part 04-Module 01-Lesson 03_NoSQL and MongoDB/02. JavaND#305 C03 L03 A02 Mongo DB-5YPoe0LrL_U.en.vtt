00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
The name MongoDB comes from the word "Humongous".

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.074
It is built to scale and store lots and lots of data.

00:00:09.074 --> 00:00:15.164
Similar to MySQL, MongoDB also follows the client-server model.

00:00:15.164 --> 00:00:19.859
In MongoDB, data is organized into documents.

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.489
Documents are a collection of key value pairs.

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:29.265
The values can be scholar types like numbers, dates, and strings.

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:32.024
The values can also be arrays,

00:00:32.024 --> 00:00:35.869
other documents, or arrays of documents.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:39.199
Documents are organized into collections.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.594
A set of collections is organized into a database.

00:00:43.594 --> 00:00:47.750
A typical document in MongoDB looks like this.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.564
As you can see, the structure is very similar to JSON.

00:00:52.564 --> 00:00:57.459
But MongoDB documents are represented in BSON format.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.975
BSON is a serialization format used to store documents in MongoDB.

00:01:02.975 --> 00:01:06.394
BSON stands for Binary JSON.

00:01:06.394 --> 00:01:11.574
Think of BSON as a binary representation of JSON documents.

00:01:11.575 --> 00:01:15.359
In MongoDB, each document stored in a collection

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:19.789
requires a unique underscore ID field that access a primary key.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.600
If an inserted document omits the underscore ID field,

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:27.304
the MongoDB database automatically generates one.

00:01:27.305 --> 00:01:31.130
Let's see how some relational concepts map to

00:01:31.129 --> 00:01:34.670
MongoDB so you can kind of co-relate them with MySQL.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.549
A database in a relational model maps to a database in MongoDB.

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.719
A table maps to a collection,

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:45.060
a row to a document,

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.750
and finally, a column maps to a field.
