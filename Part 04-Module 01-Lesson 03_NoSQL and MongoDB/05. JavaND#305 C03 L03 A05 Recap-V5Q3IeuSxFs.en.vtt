Great job on finishing Lesson 3.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.594
You now have a basic understanding of NoSQL databases and MongoDB.

00:00:08.595 --> 00:00:12.910
Let's do a quick recap of what you've done so far.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.219
You installed and setup MongoDB,

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:18.884
you created a collection,

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:21.645
inserted, and query documents from it.

00:00:21.644 --> 00:00:25.335
You learn the fundamentals of MongoDB data modeling,

00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:31.050
and finally, you learned the pros and cons of embedded documents versus references.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.195
I can't wait to show you how to use MongoDB in your Java application.

00:00:36.195 --> 00:00:38.520
See you in the next lesson.
