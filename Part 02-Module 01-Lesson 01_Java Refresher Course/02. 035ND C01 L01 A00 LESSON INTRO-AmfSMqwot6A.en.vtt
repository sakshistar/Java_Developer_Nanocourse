We're beginning our class with some really helpful Java APIs.

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:09.344
Then, we're going to learn some algorithms like Ben research and recursion.

00:00:09.345 --> 00:00:13.905
After that, we're moving on to collections like lists,

00:00:13.904 --> 00:00:17.849
Q, stock, set and map.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.010

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.580
So we have a lot of topics to cover. Let's gets started.
