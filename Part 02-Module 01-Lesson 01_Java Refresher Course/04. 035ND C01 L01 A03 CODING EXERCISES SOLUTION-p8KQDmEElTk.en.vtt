00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.825
So here's my solution for the coding problems.

00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:05.429
So for the problem,

00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:09.495
we are trying to find all the laws inside of the string.

00:00:09.494 --> 00:00:10.934
So what do we do is,

00:00:10.935 --> 00:00:15.810
we're using because the string is immutable objects.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:21.089
So we don't want to construct the new string is using the string only.

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:28.210
Instead, we're using a StringBuilder and we are having the law over here, a IOU.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:36.820
We iterating through the input and we're changing the input into a CharArray in here.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.870
For each char, if this is a wall,

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:46.644
we keep it and we add it to the StringBuilder.

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:50.030
We're using the append to add that to the StringBuilder.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.410
We're using the two lowercase in making sure that if

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:59.659
the input has an uppercase we're still append that to the string.

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:06.454
Then we return that to the output. Let's test it out.

00:01:06.454 --> 00:01:11.105
So we have a task which have two test cases.

00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:14.615
The first one we are using the input as Hello World.

00:01:14.614 --> 00:01:20.254
You will notice all the uppercasing here and a special cases.

00:01:20.254 --> 00:01:31.359
For second case, we are using USE courses which also we have the uppercase and the space.

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:38.400
The expected output for the first one is e00 here.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.960
Because you can see e over here,

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:42.569
o over here, and o over here.

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:46.009
The expected output for the second one is

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.689
the uppercase U and all lowercase aioue over here.

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:59.984
Let's run it. Our program paths ought two tests.

00:01:59.984 --> 00:02:03.010
Hope you get the right answer.
