00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.714
In this Java refreshment course,

00:00:02.714 --> 00:00:07.919
we learn some really helpful Java APIs and their syntax.

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.754
Then recover a few algorithms,

00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:13.860
like binary search and recursion.

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:17.280
We explained how to calculate Big O for

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.270
a program to understand your algorithm's performance.

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.660
After that, we cover some collections,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.300
and then we covered exception handling an IO in Java.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.390
I hope you enjoyed the coding exercises and this course. I'll see you later.
