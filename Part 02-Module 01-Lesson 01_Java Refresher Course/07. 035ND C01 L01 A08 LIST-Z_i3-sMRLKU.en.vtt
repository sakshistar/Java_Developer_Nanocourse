00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.343
In Java list is an interface,

00:00:03.343 --> 00:00:09.345
an ArrayList and LinkedList are two common implementations for lists.

00:00:09.345 --> 00:00:14.310
The differences between ArrayList and LinkedList are;

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:23.640
ArrayList use dynamic array where LinkedList use doubly-linked list to store element.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.505
I will detail the differences next,

00:00:26.504 --> 00:00:31.019
please take a look at their API documents and see if you can solve

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.100
the quizzes and coding problems on your own. Good luck.
