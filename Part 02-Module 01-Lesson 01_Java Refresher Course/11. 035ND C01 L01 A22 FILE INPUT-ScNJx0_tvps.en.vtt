00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.514
For Infostring obtained in per byte profile,

00:00:04.514 --> 00:00:11.894
it is used to read bytes oriented-data like image data, audio, videos.

00:00:11.894 --> 00:00:14.969
You can also read character string data,

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:21.280
but it's recommended to use far reader costs to read character string data.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:27.359
For upper string is upper string used for writing data to a file.

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.589
If you have primitive values into a file,

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:33.899
you'd follow upper string class.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:43.695
You can write byte-oriented as well as tetra-oriented data to a file upper string class.

00:00:43.695 --> 00:00:46.125
But for character-oriented data,

00:00:46.125 --> 00:00:51.340
it is preferred to use file reader than file upper string.
