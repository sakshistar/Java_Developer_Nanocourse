00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.024
Let's talk about exception first.

00:00:02.024 --> 00:00:06.720
Exception is a problem that arise during runtime.

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:12.899
So below are some common exceptions that won't be captured during compile time,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.644
but it will happen during the runtime.

00:00:15.644 --> 00:00:19.829
For example, if I use 10 divided by zero,

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:22.004
it will give me exception.

00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:26.879
If I start in a non-list and I'm trying to get the size of the list,

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:28.574
it will give me exception.

00:00:28.574 --> 00:00:31.314
Same thing here, if I'm to have a string,

00:00:31.315 --> 00:00:34.445
I'm trying to parse that to integer,

00:00:34.445 --> 00:00:36.380
the exception will happen.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.804
If I have an integer array and I'm trying to get a number that has outside of it's array,

00:00:42.804 --> 00:00:44.674
it will give me exception.

00:00:44.674 --> 00:00:50.239
So if you don't have an exception handling mechanism and when exception happens,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.935
the system will crash.

00:00:51.935 --> 00:00:56.750
Therefore, is very important that we have a way to properly

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.429
handle our exceptions so that we can keep our system running.
