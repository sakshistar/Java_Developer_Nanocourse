00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
Greetings. What is the best way to learn a programming language?

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.040
To practice, right?

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.560
Let's work out some of your programming problems.

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:12.179
[inaudible] is think about using

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.134
the right data structure and algorithm that fit for this problem.

00:00:18.135 --> 00:00:22.560
Meanwhile, if you can solve the problem with

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:27.104
the ideal solution which is the best time complicity,

00:00:27.105 --> 00:00:33.284
use less memory, then you should think about using the [inaudible]  force.

00:00:33.284 --> 00:00:36.884
If you can't solve them with the [inaudible] solution then

00:00:36.884 --> 00:00:41.259
you try to optimize it. Have fun coding.
