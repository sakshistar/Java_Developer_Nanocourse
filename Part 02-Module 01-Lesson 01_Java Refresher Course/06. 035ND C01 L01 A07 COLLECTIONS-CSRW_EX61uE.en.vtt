00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.379
In this lesson, we're going to continue our Java refreshment course.

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:10.199
I'm going to cover collection which including: List,

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:14.189
stack, queue, set, and map.

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:17.669
Again, rather than going through each implementation,

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.270
this course will only cover some basic implantations.

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.285
If you're interested, I will give you some links

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:27.315
where you can find more implantations on your own.

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:30.705
But you should be able to solve all the quizzes,

00:00:30.704 --> 00:00:36.729
and coding accesses with errors you learned from this lesson.
