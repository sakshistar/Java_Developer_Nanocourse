00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.240
In this video I'm going to introduce two interesting data structure: stack and queue.

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:11.535
Stack follow first in last out principle.

00:00:11.535 --> 00:00:13.859
That's it when you're adding element,

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:15.945
you're adding that to the top,

00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:18.254
and when you remove element,

00:00:18.254 --> 00:00:20.714
you also remove that from top.

00:00:20.714 --> 00:00:23.925
On the other hand, queue follows first in,

00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:29.115
first out, which is when you adding an element you're adding that down to the bottom.

00:00:29.114 --> 00:00:30.599
When you remove element,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.895
you remove that from top.

00:00:32.895 --> 00:00:38.470
Let's take a look at an example we have and understand them better.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.005
To help you better understand what is first in,

00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:44.330
first out or first in,

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:51.265
last out, let's use an example to illustrate how stack and queue works.

00:00:51.265 --> 00:00:56.189
From adding number 1-5 to stack and queue,

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:58.864
the order will look like this.

00:00:58.865 --> 00:01:01.685
If I'm adding 1-5 to stack,

00:01:01.685 --> 00:01:03.650
I'm adding always on the top,

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.390
and this is the order for stack.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.805
If I'm adding 1-5 to queue,

00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:13.885
I'm always adding to the bottom.

00:01:13.885 --> 00:01:15.734
If I remove that,

00:01:15.734 --> 00:01:18.375
I will remove from top for the queue,

00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:21.180
I remove top from the stack.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.560
So for example, if I take three numbers out from the stack,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.320
I'm taking 5, 4, 3.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.939
If I'm taking three number from the queue,

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.405
I am taking 1, 2, and 3.

00:01:39.405 --> 00:01:44.670
I hope this give you a better understanding what is first in,

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.114
first out or first in, last out.

00:01:48.114 --> 00:01:54.064
Let's take a look at the quizzes we have and also take a look

00:01:54.064 --> 00:02:00.429
at the coding access we have to help you better understand queue and stack.
