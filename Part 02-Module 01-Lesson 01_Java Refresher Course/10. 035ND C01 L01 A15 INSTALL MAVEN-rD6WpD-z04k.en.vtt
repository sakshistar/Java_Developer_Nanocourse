00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.570
In this video, I'm going to show you how to install to Maven Plugin IntelliJ.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.574
So here is our IntelliJ project,

00:00:10.574 --> 00:00:12.734
and what do you want to do is,

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:16.289
you want to open the Preference,

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.899
and go to Plugins,

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:21.640
and searching for Maven.

00:00:22.309 --> 00:00:26.174
So I already has a Plugin installed.

00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:30.524
So if you want to know the name of the Plugin,

00:00:30.524 --> 00:00:32.309
it's called Maven Integration.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.484
So if you're not have it installed,

00:00:34.484 --> 00:00:38.640
could marketplace and search for Maven Integration,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.875
and just install it.

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:45.450
If you have the Maven Plugin installed in your IntelliJ,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.135
it will show up in the right-hand side in the sidebar and we open it,

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:53.679
you will see something like this.
