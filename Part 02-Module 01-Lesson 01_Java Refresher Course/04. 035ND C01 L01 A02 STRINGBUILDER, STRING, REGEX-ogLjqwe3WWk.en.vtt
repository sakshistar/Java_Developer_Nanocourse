00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.004
Difference in string, StringBuilder and StringBuffer are mutable.

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:07.035
Both classes create a mutable sequence of

00:00:07.035 --> 00:00:11.714
characters as they are very much similar to each other.

00:00:11.714 --> 00:00:15.060
However, StringBuilder provide no guarantee

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.035
of synchronization, whereas StringBuffer does.

00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:26.714
As for rejects aka regular expression is used to match or filter our strings.

00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:30.704
Again please take a look at the API documents on your own,

00:00:30.704 --> 00:00:36.670
and see if you can solve the crisis and coding problems. See you in a bit.
