00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
In previous video, I showed you that what

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.765
happen if we don't have Exception handling mechanism.

00:00:05.765 --> 00:00:10.395
I have shown you some Exception Handling and syntax in Java.

00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:16.110
In this video, I'm going to show you a program that will show you if exception

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:23.325
happens and I am using some exception handling mechanism to deal with that.

00:00:23.325 --> 00:00:25.500
So here's our program.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.950
In this program, I'm trying to use 100 divided by 0,

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.745
which should give me Exceptional here.

00:00:35.745 --> 00:00:37.955
But if I catch that,

00:00:37.955 --> 00:00:43.865
this a try-catch block and let's see what happens.

00:00:43.865 --> 00:00:52.400
Let me run this, and I should get something like this in my console.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.235
So we're saying what the exception is,

00:00:56.235 --> 00:00:59.195
I'm printing the exception stack trace.

00:00:59.195 --> 00:01:02.750
But the rest of my code is still running.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.255
If I'm ticking off this block,

00:01:05.255 --> 00:01:08.905
my distributed won't be executed.

00:01:08.905 --> 00:01:12.890
So in this program I'll show you how important it

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.525
is to have exception handling mechanism.

00:01:17.525 --> 00:01:23.100
So that even as you happen the rest the code will still run.
