00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.585
In this video I'm going to cover Java IO.

00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:10.105
Java IO is API that come with Java to read and write data.

00:00:10.105 --> 00:00:13.320
Most of the application today support IO.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.574
For instance, system allows user to upload a data feed,

00:00:19.574 --> 00:00:23.730
system ask user to upload a photo,

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.609
system generate a PDF of the user complete the form.

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.060
So there are three parts of IO here.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.880
So I'm starting with introducing what IO is.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.330
Then I am going to introduce what is Stream.

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.765
After that I'm going through the list of APIs from file to

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:54.770
let you understand how to operate and how to manipulate the file using Java IO.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:02.855
Java file class in Java IO API give you the access to the underlying file system.

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:04.849
Using the file class,

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:08.879
you can check if the file or directory exists.

00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:17.299
The file class in Java IO API gives you the access to the underlying file system.

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.295
You can use it to check

00:01:19.295 --> 00:01:25.625
if a file or directory exists or create a directory if that does not exist.

00:01:25.625 --> 00:01:27.864
To read the length of the file,

00:01:27.864 --> 00:01:31.814
rename or move the file, delete a file,

00:01:31.814 --> 00:01:35.640
check if a path is a file or directory,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.359
read a list of file in a directory.
