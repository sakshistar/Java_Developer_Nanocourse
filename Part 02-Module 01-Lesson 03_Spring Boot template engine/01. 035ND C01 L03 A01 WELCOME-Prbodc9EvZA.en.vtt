00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.705
Welcome back. In the previous lesson,

00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:05.804
we have introduced microservice,

00:00:05.804 --> 00:00:09.525
MVC Framework and Spring Boot Framework.

00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:16.030
I believe now you have a good sense about how to create a simple Spring Boot application.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.780
In this lesson, we're going to learn template engine.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.075
So what is template engine?

00:00:24.074 --> 00:00:30.039
Template engine also known as template processor or template parser,

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:36.214
it combines data model with source template to produce result documents,

00:00:36.215 --> 00:00:39.380
the result document can be any file type.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.000
Here are some components in template engine flow,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.384
we have data model which can be any data,

00:00:47.384 --> 00:00:52.344
it can be data from database, XML, spreadsheet.

00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:55.475
The source template can be any file type,

00:00:55.475 --> 00:01:01.829
it can be HTML, XML, or XHTML.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:12.020
The template engine connect to datatype and processing code in source template.

00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:18.840
The result document is the result of partial or entire document.

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.439
Here's the template engine flow,

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:30.939
you can see that the template engine connect the data and template as the input,

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.905
and the output of the template engine is a result document.

00:01:35.905 --> 00:01:38.894
Now that you know what template engine is,

00:01:38.894 --> 00:01:43.409
I'm going to show you three major template engine in Spring Boot,

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:52.259
which are FreeMarker, Thymeleaf, and JSP.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.055
We're going to focus on Thymeleaf for this lesson,

00:01:56.055 --> 00:02:01.465
but I'll still give you a brief introduction on FreeMarker.

00:02:01.465 --> 00:02:04.139
We are not going to call it JSP,

00:02:04.138 --> 00:02:09.044
because JSP is not well used in Spring Boot applications.

00:02:09.044 --> 00:02:11.094
In our next video,

00:02:11.094 --> 00:02:18.210
we're going to start learning template engine in Spring Boot and how to use it.
