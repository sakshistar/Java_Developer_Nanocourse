In this lesson, we have covered Spring Boot,

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:07.875
template engine and we'll focus on thymeleaf.

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:12.884
After that, we'll also cover how to create a unit test,

00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:16.155
to test over a Spring Boot Application.

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:19.065
How to enable Hot Swap,

00:00:19.065 --> 00:00:23.380
use DevTool to speed up to the development.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.230
How to save logging to trap problems, use LogBack.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.475
We also covered how to use validation annotation to do

00:00:35.475 --> 00:00:41.969
form validation to making sure that all our obligation is protected.

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.354
