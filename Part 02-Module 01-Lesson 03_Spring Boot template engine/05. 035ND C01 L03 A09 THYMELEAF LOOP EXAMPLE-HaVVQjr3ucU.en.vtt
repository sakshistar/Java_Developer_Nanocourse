00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.669
So let's take a look at the example we had.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.979
We've created a list of users,

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:11.669
there's ID, name, and age.

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:15.615
They pass this list to our view.

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:18.074
This is our view,

00:00:18.074 --> 00:00:21.085
if you notice we are creating a table.

00:00:21.085 --> 00:00:24.469
We iterating through the list.

00:00:24.469 --> 00:00:29.699
I'm printing out the ID, name and age.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.984
This is how it look like in our browser.

00:00:32.984 --> 00:00:39.104
As you can see that we're printing to use a list in

00:00:39.104 --> 00:00:46.319
our browser successfully with loop statement we have in Thymeleaf.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.509
I hope you set up correctly in this.
