00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.889
I hope you'll get the right result.

00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:05.984
A few things you might notice during the experiment.

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:10.304
We are using the Controller this time rather than RestController.

00:00:10.304 --> 00:00:15.120
To clarify, RestController is used to tell that

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.679
the response sent from your Controller should be central [inaudible] ,

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.425
purely an object map to the JSON.

00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:25.585
The same as adding response body,

00:00:25.585 --> 00:00:29.905
we're adding the view in template rather than static folder.

00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:34.710
So this is the template engine flow for FreeMarker.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.320
It's pretty much the same as any template engines.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:47.079
So we are combining the template and Java code in FreeMarker into the HTML.
