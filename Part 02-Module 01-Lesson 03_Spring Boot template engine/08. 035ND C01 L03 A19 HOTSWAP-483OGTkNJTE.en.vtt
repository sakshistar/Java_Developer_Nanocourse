00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.884
For all the Spring Boot access you did before,

00:00:03.884 --> 00:00:07.535
you might find out even for simple type of fix,

00:00:07.535 --> 00:00:12.644
you have to stop and restart the application server to see the change.

00:00:12.644 --> 00:00:17.879
This is not convenient and greatly slow down our development.

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:19.799
In the next few videos,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.475
I'm going to show you how to set up your Spring Boot application with hot swap.

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:28.260
So when you make a change,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.190
the application server will do a hot swap to apply

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.390
the change to avoid stop and restart the application server.
