00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.115
If you set up correctly,

00:00:02.115 --> 00:00:06.464
you should see that validations working.

00:00:06.464 --> 00:00:13.320
First, we're adding the @NotBlank annotation for username and password.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.330
This error message to

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.329
our user cause to make sure that these two attributes cannot be empty,

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:24.044
where it turned from view.

00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:30.810
We add it rarely annotation in our controller and passing the model value to view.

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:32.640
If it's not valid,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.515
it will go back to form and render the error message we defined in our user model.

00:00:39.515 --> 00:00:49.120
We update our view to include errors tag to render more errors view.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.520
So here is all the thing we added in our example one.
