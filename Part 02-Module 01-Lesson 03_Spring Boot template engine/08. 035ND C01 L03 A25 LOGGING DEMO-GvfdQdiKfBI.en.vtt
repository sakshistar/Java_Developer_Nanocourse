00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
If you follow the instruction,

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.790
you'll see the log domain appear in the console

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.289
and the log file you've defined in your application.property file.

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:18.179
As you can see, we added a dependency for log4j2, your pom.xml.

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:24.314
We have added the log file paths in our controller.

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:29.800
This will trigger when I go to the log.pass.

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:36.750
Let's take a look. So I'm trying to trigger

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.890
that and then we'll see that error seeing will be logged on here.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.200
If you open the log file, you'll see that as well.
