00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560
If error seen setup correctly,

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.750
you should see a test case passed

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.355
recruited of Spring Boot unit tests to test your unit service.

00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:11.535
It is very similar to unit test.

00:00:11.535 --> 00:00:15.900
In addition, the edit annotation [inaudible] a

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.355
Spring Boot to indicate this is a Spring Boot test.

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:26.295
Let's run it. So what we are doing here is,

00:00:26.295 --> 00:00:30.910
we're getting a user from the user service.

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:37.299
As you can see the format is very much similar to unit test.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:50.135
If you run the test, you will notice that it is a Spring Boot unit tests.

00:00:50.134 --> 00:00:56.879
It is different than the J unit tests we have done before for Java.
