In the next few videos,

00:00:01.784 --> 00:00:03.794
I'm going to talk about Thymeleaf,

00:00:03.794 --> 00:00:09.000
which is highly recommended to Spring Boot for template engine.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.990
Like Euro, Let's start with a example.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.170
Thymeleaf is an in-memory template engine,

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.890
so it does all its processing in memory.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:28.200
If use a [inaudible] the maps to the HTML of the page in memory and the value changes.

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.949
So parse page are also changed.

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.369
Thymeleaf is a compute engine that relies mostly on attributes installed paths,

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:41.099
like what GSP does.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:49.270
This make it testable in the browser directly without requiring a server.
