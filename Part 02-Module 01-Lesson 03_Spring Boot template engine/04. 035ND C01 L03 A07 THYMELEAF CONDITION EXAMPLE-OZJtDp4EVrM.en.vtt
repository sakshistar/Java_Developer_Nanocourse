00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.049
In this demo, I'm creating a student and give the student a grade.

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.969
I'm using all the condition in cognitive.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.875
So first condition is,

00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:17.475
if a student grade is greater than 60,

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:20.220
so means assume pass exam,

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:26.519
and we're showing the level of the student using switch case.

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.429
If the grade is less than 60,

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.219
means the student failed the exam.

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.454
This is our view,

00:00:34.454 --> 00:00:36.119
and in the controller,

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:39.809
we're passing a grade of the student.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.170
We are converting the grade to the GPA so that we can show

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.810
this in the view. Let's take a look.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.370
If you remember, we are passing 90.

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:57.390
When rendering, first of all,

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.520
you'll see the student pass the exam and when look entry-level,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.350
the student is excellent.
