00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560
So in this example,

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.960
we're adding all the common annotations we know for SpringBoot.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.460
So we are keeping this too for the username and password.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.140
For the password, we're adding a length to making sure

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:21.460
that the password length is between 6-10.

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:26.399
We're adding two checks for the grade,

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:31.904
because grade cannot be negative and cannot be over 100.

00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:38.914
We're adding an email tag to making sure that the email format is valid.

00:00:38.914 --> 00:00:42.530
Let's try it. So here's our form.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.109
Let's try to input some invalid inflammation.

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:50.534
Let's leave this username blank,

00:00:50.534 --> 00:00:53.654
lets have three digit for password,

00:00:53.655 --> 00:00:56.745
let's put a negative number here,

00:00:56.744 --> 00:01:01.179
and let's try this invalid email.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.629
So as you see, all the invalidation is working,

00:01:09.629 --> 00:01:15.784
meaning all this information will not even be send to controller, the process.

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:19.759
You will be stopped at the validation level.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.010
With this validation, we could protect our application from

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:32.340
malicious input from user to make our application more safe.
