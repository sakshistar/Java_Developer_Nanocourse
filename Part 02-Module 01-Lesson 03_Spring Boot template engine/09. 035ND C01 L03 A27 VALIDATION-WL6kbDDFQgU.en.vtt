Most of the web application require user input.

00:00:04.105 --> 00:00:12.224
Without input validation, it is easy to trigger a security concerns like cross-site,

00:00:12.224 --> 00:00:17.355
scripting aka XSS attack,

00:00:17.355 --> 00:00:20.250
and SQL Injection attack.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.969
Therefore, validation is very important when building a web application.

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:32.969
In this lesson, I'm going to show you how to use Hibernate

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.670
validate annotation to achieve simple Spring Boot validation.
