00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
Now that you should have to Spring Boot down to our setup,

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.960
let's do some testing to make sure we got what we were expecting.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.269
So I'm going to use the same example here.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:27.615
So we're going to use the same example here for the student grade.

00:00:27.614 --> 00:00:29.250
So instead of saying,

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.895
"You passed your exam" in the browser, I will say,

00:00:32.895 --> 00:00:35.370
"You successfully passed your exam."

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:37.589
So now I change this to,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.545
"You successfully passed your exam."

00:00:40.545 --> 00:00:43.570
Let's see what [inaudible] changes.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.440
So now you see without restarting the application server,

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:58.909
with the [inaudible] we can change the code and restart it with the [inaudible].

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:02.909
Let's try to see if we can change the Java code instead.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.355
So if you remember,

00:01:06.355 --> 00:01:10.219
we gave the grade 90 so that it passed the exam.

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:13.769
Let's change it to 40 to see how it works.

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.750
So after I save it,

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.780
you'll notice that in the console,

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.609
the application server is on [inaudible] restart.

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:34.950
Let's take a look at the browser.

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:42.228
So instead of saying, you had passed the exam,

00:01:42.228 --> 00:01:45.969
this time because of 40, you failed exam.

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:48.000
With the [inaudible]

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.849
you don't have to restart the application server, every time we make a change.
