00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
Let's take a look at the example for scope.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.540
In this example, we are passing the requests,

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:11.894
we are passing the session,

00:00:11.894 --> 00:00:14.759
and we are passing the application.

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.884
We're passing all this information to our view.

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:22.929
Let's take a look at our view.

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:26.219
This is our view,

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:32.564
that our view retrieving the information from the controller.

00:00:32.564 --> 00:00:38.500
Were using syntax to retrieve the request, session, and application.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.795
Let's take a look at our browser.

00:00:42.795 --> 00:00:44.820
So here is our browser.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:52.280
It shows that we are getting all of the data for our request, session, and obligation.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.799
Now you should know how to set attributes in different scope like request,

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:03.379
session, and application, and how to retrieve them in Canvas.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.144
This scope are very helpful when you have

00:01:07.144 --> 00:01:12.979
multiple pages and want to pass to attributes from this page to another.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.730
For instance, if you want to make sure that each page validate the user session,

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.469
you can have the user ID in each session.

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:26.644
If a page can now verify the user ID in session,

00:01:26.644 --> 00:01:29.569
meaning, null or empty,

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:32.759
the page will not be rendered.
