00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
In order for Spring Boot unit test to run a batch job,

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.910
the framework must load to jobs obligation contacts.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.000
Two annotations are used to trigger this.

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:16.769
We start with the RunWith indicates that

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:22.269
the class should be used Spring Boot Unit test facilities.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.475
We're adding SpringBootTest annotation.

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:30.885
With this annotation, Spring Boot provides a convenient way to

00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:36.219
start up an application contexts to be used in a test.

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:42.229
We can replace the SpringBootTest with ContextsConfiguration.

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:45.579
The behavior are similar.
