00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.230
Here are some common Spring Boot validation annotations.

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.890
Not blank, not empty,

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.120
length, with checking the string length,

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:16.714
include the max and min.

00:00:16.714 --> 00:00:22.035
So minimum will check if the number is smaller than this.

00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:25.094
It cannot be less than that.

00:00:25.094 --> 00:00:27.979
Use a max to check the max number.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.115
It cannot be go over with.

00:00:30.114 --> 00:00:33.799
Use the e-mail to check the e-mail format.

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:37.679
It should be look like something like this.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:45.240
So let's go through this example and see what changes we have made so far.
