00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
There are many ways to achieve Hot Swap in Spring Boot.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.664
In this lesson, we are going to use Spring Boot DevTool module.

00:00:10.664 --> 00:00:14.849
With DevTool module, we can achieve the following things.

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:23.625
We can reload static content like HTML, image, CSS, etc.

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:30.129
We can reload to template like thymeleaf or FreeMarker.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:37.980
We can reload our Java classes and we'll have fast application restart,

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:44.339
because the DevTool module includes support for automatic obligation restart.
