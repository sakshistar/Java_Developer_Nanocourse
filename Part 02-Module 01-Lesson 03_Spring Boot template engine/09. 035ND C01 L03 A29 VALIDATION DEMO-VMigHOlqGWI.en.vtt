00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.665
In the last video, we have used NotBlank annotation to check

00:00:04.665 --> 00:00:10.859
if the string entered for username and password is null or empty.

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:19.365
Let's try to use other annotations and see if we can improve this application.

00:00:19.364 --> 00:00:24.404
So in addition to checking the username and password.

00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:30.900
In this demo, I'm also checking the length of the password so

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:40.019
that it has minimum length of six and maximum of 10.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.020
I also check to see on the grade,

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.090
because grade cannot be negative or more than 100.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:57.359
I'm using an e-mail validation tag to check the format of the e-mail input by user.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.289
So that's our model.

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.510
Let's take a look at the controller we have.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.144
So the controller is part of the scene,

00:01:08.144 --> 00:01:12.334
it's only difference is we're adding the binding result

00:01:12.334 --> 00:01:17.719
to our controller so that if anything is incorrect,

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:23.060
so we're binding other result here and sending back to the view.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.405
In our view as you can see,

00:01:29.405 --> 00:01:38.734
we're adding all the error statement for each attribute or each element in this form.

00:01:38.734 --> 00:01:41.620
Let's try to test it.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.190
So you can see that we have our form here.

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.814
Let's try to input some invite data.

00:01:48.814 --> 00:01:50.310
Let's leave this blank,

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.680
let's have three digit for the password,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.095
let's have a negative grade,

00:01:55.094 --> 00:01:59.950
and lets have an inverted e-mail for the e-mail field.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.245
We click that you will see that the error is returned to the view and go rendered,

00:02:08.245 --> 00:02:18.349
and you will find the form is validated with all the validation annotation we have.

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:25.444
So here are some common annotations for use to validate Spring Boot.

00:02:25.444 --> 00:02:33.435
NotBlank, NotEmpty, Length which include the max and minimum.

00:02:33.435 --> 00:02:38.800
It's a Min, Max, Email, etc.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.710
So while using this,

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:47.830
we can use all of this annotations to validate the user inputs in Spring Boot.
