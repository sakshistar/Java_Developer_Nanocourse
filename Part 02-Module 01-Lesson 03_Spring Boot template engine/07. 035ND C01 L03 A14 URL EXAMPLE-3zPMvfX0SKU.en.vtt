00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
Next, I'm going to show you how to create URLs in your web application,

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.435
so that they incur any required URL preparation artifacts.

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:14.339
Just a term by means of so-called link expression.

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:18.179
A type of ThymeLeaf standard expression.

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:20.759
Let's take all glad to demo first.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.525
If it technically URL was set up in our view,

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:29.579
the first is we're passing nothing to the new page.

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.625
The second one, we're passing the ID,

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:35.804
and then to our new view.

00:00:35.804 --> 00:00:40.799
So this is how this link get rendered in the browser.

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:43.884
So the first link if you click that,

00:00:43.884 --> 00:00:49.019
it will take you to the demo view with no parameter.

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.369
If you click the second link,

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:55.599
you'll also go to the demo view,

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.170
but this time it will have its ID equals to one,

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.734
and then equals to Eric parameter within the western link.

00:01:06.734 --> 00:01:09.704
That's it for our ThymeLeaf introduction.

00:01:09.704 --> 00:01:11.364
If you want to learn more,

00:01:11.364 --> 00:01:19.579
