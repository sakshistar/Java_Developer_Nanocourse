00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.100
In order to generate Java classes from a WSDL file,

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:09.625
there's some setup that needs to happen in your Maven palm file.

00:00:09.625 --> 00:00:11.734
So let's navigate there.

00:00:11.734 --> 00:00:13.594
At the very bottom,

00:00:13.595 --> 00:00:16.344
there is a plugin section.

00:00:16.344 --> 00:00:22.849
So specifically, this plugin here found on line 75 through 92.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.050
So this plugin uses

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.300
JAXB which generates the Java classes and

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.289
handles the mapping of XML to Java and vice versa.

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:36.189
The line on 87 is very important because it points to

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:40.044
the WSDL file that the plugin will use to generate the Java code.

00:00:40.045 --> 00:00:41.829
Let's scroll back up.

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.109
There are additional dependencies that I've

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:48.755
added here this marshaling and unmarshaling section.

00:00:48.755 --> 00:00:54.170
That's lines 40 all the way down through 63.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.230
So these are additional dependencies that also

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:00.814
help with mapping XML to Java and vice versa.

00:01:00.814 --> 00:01:02.710
So those are necessary.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.644
Now, in order to generate the Java classes,

00:01:05.644 --> 00:01:09.079
you'll have to run the Maven generate-sources command.

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:13.459
Now, this can be easily done via the command line or through IntelliJ.

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:15.769
I'm going to use it through IntellJ.

00:01:15.769 --> 00:01:18.694
My project is set up as a Maven project.

00:01:18.694 --> 00:01:22.625
If you notice here on this far right-hand side,

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:24.594
this option says Maven,

00:01:24.594 --> 00:01:26.159
and if you click on it,

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.034
it opens the Maven configurations for your project.

00:01:30.034 --> 00:01:33.170
So I want to run the Maven generate-sources command.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.525
So I will click on this that says "Execute Maven Goal" and a window will pop up.

00:01:39.525 --> 00:01:42.975
Then, here, you can enter generate-sources.

00:01:42.974 --> 00:01:44.819
Let's click Execute.

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:49.189
I'll expand this window down here so you can see what's happening.

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.329
So we have build success. So that's it.

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.049
So this results in a number of generated Java classes.

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.375
Let me show you where those are.

00:01:59.375 --> 00:02:02.209
Those are under this target folder.

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:06.924
Go to generate-sources and look for XJC.

00:02:06.924 --> 00:02:10.550
Underneath this, you'll see all of the classes that you need,

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.405
so com, data access, web services server.

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:19.655
In here, we have the requests files and the response files.

00:02:19.655 --> 00:02:23.150
So we'll use these classes when we implement

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.275
the client that actually calls out to the soap service.

00:02:27.275 --> 00:02:30.650
The next step is to create a client for

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.115
the number service to create a web service client.

00:02:34.115 --> 00:02:37.594
You simply extend the WebServiceGatewaySupport class,

00:02:37.594 --> 00:02:40.500
and code your operations.
