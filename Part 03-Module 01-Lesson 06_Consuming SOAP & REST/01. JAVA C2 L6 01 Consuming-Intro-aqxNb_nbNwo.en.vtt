00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.784
Hello, I'm Kisho Williams.

00:00:01.784 --> 00:00:02.969
Welcome to my course,

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.085
web services and APIs.

00:00:05.084 --> 00:00:07.049
Today, I'm going to teach you about using

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.675
a third-party RESTful API or SOAP-based web service in your existing applications.

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:17.820
Third parties simply means it was developed by another developer or organization.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.074
If there's a third party service already on the market,

00:00:21.074 --> 00:00:23.550
it will jumpstart your development process.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.179
I will teach you about REST template which Spring

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.519
provides for programmatically calling REST APIs.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.864
We will look at Jackson,

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:36.835
which is a library that serializes or maps Java objects to JSON and vice versa.

00:00:36.835 --> 00:00:41.075
Next, I will teach you about consuming a SOAP-base API.

00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:45.440
We will discuss Spring web services which provides functionality to

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:50.570
automatically generate the files you need in order to consume a SOAP web service.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.689
We will look at the code generation process and create

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:57.530
a client to invoke the web service using the generated code.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.969
So let's get started.
