00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.384
Let's see this in action.

00:00:02.384 --> 00:00:06.379
Start by cloning the code from the link found in the course notes section.

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:10.769
The soap project is different from the one that we use for the Rest example.

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.779
Now, let's look at the wsdl file,

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:15.719
it's also known as the service description file.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.685
So this is the URL to the wsdl,

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:22.229
I've downloaded it and included it in my project.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.734
So let's navigate to intelligence.

00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:26.414
You can open the code,

00:00:26.414 --> 00:00:32.024
and navigate to number conversion.wsdl is found underneath the resources folder,

00:00:32.024 --> 00:00:34.335
and then underneath a wsdl folder.

00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:36.149
So let's take a look at this.

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.143
So this is the service description and it tells more about the service,

00:00:40.143 --> 00:00:44.390
I particularly want to know about the operations available.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.054
So let's search for that.

00:00:46.054 --> 00:00:48.250
Notice there are two operations,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.159
Number ToWords here, and Number ToDollars.

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:55.879
Of course in our example we are going to use Number ToWords.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.965
Now, let's navigate to the Maven palm file to see the dependencies.

00:00:59.965 --> 00:01:03.250
Specifically, for spring web services,

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.484
you'll use the dependency as outlined here on lines 33 through 37.

00:01:08.484 --> 00:01:11.769
Notice it's called Spring- boot- Starter- web -services.

00:01:11.769 --> 00:01:17.599
So this dependency includes everything you need in order to use Spring Web services.

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:22.884
Now, let's discuss spring -web-services a bit more before we generate the Java code.

00:01:22.885 --> 00:01:27.050
Spring-ws-core also called Spring Web Services

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.724
helps with the creation and consumption of XML.

00:01:30.724 --> 00:01:36.754
Features include XML mapping to objects and vice versa using jaxb.

00:01:36.754 --> 00:01:41.824
It also includes multiple libraries to support parsing XML.

00:01:41.825 --> 00:01:45.365
Spring -ws is contract first only.

00:01:45.364 --> 00:01:49.129
This means that you need to start from a contract definition like

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:53.405
a wsdl or XSD file to generate the Java files.

00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:57.844
The next step is to generate the domain objects based on the wsdl.

00:01:57.844 --> 00:02:00.539
Let's see this in action.
