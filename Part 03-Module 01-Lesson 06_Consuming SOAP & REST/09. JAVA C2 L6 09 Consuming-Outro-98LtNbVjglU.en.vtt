00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
Today, you learned how to integrate third party RESTful APIs and SOAP

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.169
based web services into your existing applications to speed up your delivery cycle.

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:12.974
Why reinvent the wheel if you don't have to?

00:00:12.974 --> 00:00:18.134
You learned about REST template to programmatically call a REST API from your code.

00:00:18.135 --> 00:00:19.950
We then looked at Jackson,

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.570
which is a library that maps Java objects to JSON and vice versa.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.740
Next, you learned about using Spring Web services to generate

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:33.314
code from a WSDL to help you invoke a SOAP based web service.

00:00:33.314 --> 00:00:39.849
Next, you will learn about documenting the web services and APIs that you create.
