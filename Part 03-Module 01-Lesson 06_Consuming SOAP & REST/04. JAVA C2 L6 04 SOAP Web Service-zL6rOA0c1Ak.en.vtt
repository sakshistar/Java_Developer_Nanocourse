00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.035
There may be times when you want to consume

00:00:04.035 --> 00:00:07.500
a SOAP-based service as opposed to a REST-based service.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.849
The process is different from what we saw with consuming a REST API,

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.769
and it's a bit more complicated.

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.370
The public API that we are going to consume is a fun one,

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.585
that takes a number and converts it to the word form of that number.

00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:26.085
For example, if you enter 2,9,3,1,

00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:29.700
the service will return a response like this.

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.909
This response is an XML format.
