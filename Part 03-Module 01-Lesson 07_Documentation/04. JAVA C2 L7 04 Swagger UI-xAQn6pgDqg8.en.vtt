00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:04.740
Let's review swagger UI.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.740
Dynamically generated documentation from a swagger

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.160
compliant API is displayed in the swagger UI.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.214
Which consists of HTML,

00:00:13.214 --> 00:00:15.750
JavaScript, and CSS files.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.990
The documentation files are bundled by swagger UI to display the API in a web browser.

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:27.839
Besides rendering documentation, swagger UI allows other API developers or

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:29.550
consumers to interact with

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.980
the API resources without having any of the implementation logic in place.

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:38.859
So it's a great way to test APIs.
