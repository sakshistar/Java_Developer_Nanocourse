00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:07.664
Let's see documenting RESTful APIs using Swagger and action.

00:00:07.665 --> 00:00:13.094
At this point, you can clone the code using the link in the course notes section.

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:17.760
This code is for our airport locations RESTful API.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.475
We've used this in previous lessons.

00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:22.890
Let's take a look at the steps needed to configure

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.844
Swagger and then review the Swagger UI.

00:00:25.844 --> 00:00:29.924
I've open the project and I've navigated to the Maven Palm file.

00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:34.695
Let's scroll down and take a look at the dependencies needed for Swagger.

00:00:34.695 --> 00:00:37.755
Here on lines 41 through 45,

00:00:37.755 --> 00:00:40.859
you will need the springfox Swagger UI.

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:43.890
Here on lines 47 through 52,

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.674
you will need the springfox swagger2 dependency.

00:00:47.674 --> 00:00:53.359
Now the configuration of Swagger mainly centers around the docket bean and

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:59.420
that can be found in this SwaggerConfig.java file underneath the config folder.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.025
So I've created the SwaggerConfig and notice here on line

00:01:04.025 --> 00:01:09.020
18 I'm using the @EnablesSwagger2 annotation.

00:01:09.019 --> 00:01:12.774
This annotation essentially enables Swagger.

00:01:12.775 --> 00:01:18.020
Then the configuration here on line 27 through 33 hits

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:23.254
really all we need to integrate Swagger into any existing spring boot project.

00:01:23.254 --> 00:01:25.534
So let's take a look at this method.

00:01:25.534 --> 00:01:28.804
So this is the docket bean that we're creating.

00:01:28.805 --> 00:01:31.490
Notice here we're saying the documentation type is

00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:35.780
Swagger and then there's a select method on the docket beam.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.844
This returns an instance of the API selector builder which

00:01:39.844 --> 00:01:44.495
essentially controls the endpoints exposed by Swagger.

00:01:44.495 --> 00:01:47.645
Then here on lines 29 and 30,

00:01:47.644 --> 00:01:51.439
for the request handlers and the past selectors,

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.640
I'm using any here and essentially that makes

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.424
documentation available for the entire locations API.

00:02:00.424 --> 00:02:03.709
So I'm not limiting the documentation at all.

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:10.189
Swagger also provide some default values in its response that you can customize here

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:17.150
in this API info and is essentially contact information about the API.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.610
So here I include a title, description,

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.145
version, contact information, etc.

00:02:23.145 --> 00:02:26.225
This docket bean is all we need in order to

00:02:26.224 --> 00:02:29.569
configure Swagger and have access to the Swagger UI.

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.849
So I've already deployed this project.

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.069
So let's take a look at the Swagger UI.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.409
Let's remove that and just go to the main.

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.585
So this is the main page.

00:02:41.585 --> 00:02:44.665
This is the URL to get to the Swagger UI.

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:51.204
The URL is localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html.

00:02:51.205 --> 00:02:52.770
So on this screen,

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.550
Swagger lists all of the end points available in

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.570
the service and you can test all of the endpoints created for you.

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:05.009
So location controller that's our controller that we're familiar with and

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:10.909
notice it exposes two operations, getAllLocations and getLocation.

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:13.159
So let's take a look at this.

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:18.409
Notice in this documentation it lists out the parameters needed for this method,

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:23.120
in this case no parameters and it lists out the responses.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.594
So far the response code 200,

00:03:25.594 --> 00:03:28.340
it shows an example model returned.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.370
So here in address and ID and a name.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.800
So this is very helpful for people that need to consume or use your API.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.040
They can actually try it out by clicking Tryout and then clicking Execute.

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:49.729
Notice down here it shows the results of calling the getAllLocations API.

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:53.689
Notice it lists are locations, very useful.

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:56.870
Let's take a look at the second operation that's

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.200
getting a specific location by passing in the ID.

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:02.044
Let's expand this.

00:04:02.044 --> 00:04:04.219
Notice here it tells the parameters,

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:09.344
in this case there's one parameter that's an integer and it's the ID.

00:04:09.344 --> 00:04:12.455
Here again it shows the response from the API,

00:04:12.455 --> 00:04:14.344
an example model here,

00:04:14.344 --> 00:04:16.610
the address, the ID and name.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.150
Again you can test it out by clicking on try it out,

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:21.829
you enter the parameter.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.904
So let's retrieve information for location 1.

00:04:24.904 --> 00:04:29.119
You click Execute and notice we have the response body so it

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.394
returns back the details for location with an ID of one.

00:04:33.394 --> 00:04:36.365
So this is a quick look at Swagger UI,

00:04:36.365 --> 00:04:42.720
is very useful documentation tool to help others learn how to use your API.
