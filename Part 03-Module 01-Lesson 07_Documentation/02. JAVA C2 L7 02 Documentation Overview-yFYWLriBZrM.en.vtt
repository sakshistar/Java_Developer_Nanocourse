00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:07.814
It's very important to document your REST APIs.

00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:10.410
There could be other developers that need to use

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.708
your APIs to help speed up their development process,

00:00:13.708 --> 00:00:18.329
or you may have customers that want to use the data from your APIs.

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:24.195
Documentation is a good way to communicate to others how they can use your APIs.

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:26.954
Documentation communicates things like,

00:00:26.954 --> 00:00:28.574
what are the operations?

00:00:28.574 --> 00:00:31.814
For example, retrieving a list of locations.

00:00:31.815 --> 00:00:34.560
What's the format for requesting data,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.550
and what format is that data returned in?

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:41.719
Typically, the initial creation of documentation is easy,

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.399
but the ongoing maintenance of keeping that documentation up to date as hard.

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.679
Imagine having to manually update documentation every time your code changes.

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:54.200
Maybe something like the signature on a method

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.929
changes because you add additional parameters,

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:00.740
or you add new features that results in new classes,

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.590
or you deprecate or remove features.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.079
It's good to use tools that can automatically

00:01:06.078 --> 00:01:10.079
inspect your code and update the documentation for you.
