00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.965
Hello, I'm Kesha Williams.

00:00:01.965 --> 00:00:03.225
Welcome to my course,

00:00:03.225 --> 00:00:05.595
Web Services and APIs.

00:00:05.594 --> 00:00:10.259
Today, I'm going to teach you about the importance of documenting your APIs.

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:13.080
When we talk about documentation versus coding,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.019
any developer will tell you that coding is definitely

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:19.410
more fun than keeping documentation up to date.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.070
But documenting your code and APIs are important.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.269
It helps others better understand your code and your APIs.

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.259
Today, we will review Swagger which dynamically generates

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.635
documentation from your Java code and some of its components like Swagger UI.

00:00:36.634 --> 00:00:40.954
I will show you how to add Swagger to your project and configure it.

00:00:40.954 --> 00:00:46.564
We will wrap up with discussing ways to customize Swagger's output to meet your needs.

00:00:46.564 --> 00:00:48.929
So let's get started.
