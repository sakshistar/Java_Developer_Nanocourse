00:00:02.089 --> 00:00:08.324
Swagger allows globally overriding response messages of HTTP methods.

00:00:08.324 --> 00:00:12.719
So springfox will provide default messages for certain error codes.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.240
For example, 201 created,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.449
204 no content as well as several 400 responses like 404 not found.

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.280
But there may be cases when

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.225
the default response messages don't really apply for your API.

00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:30.929
So you can turn off default response messages and define

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.634
your own using the add API responses annotation.

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:37.189
So let's look at this configuration file.

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:42.530
The first step is to turn off the default responses here on line 27.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.969
So I'm saying use default response messages and I'm passing and false.

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.699
So that turns off the default responses.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.395
Now, I have to navigate to the location controller that's

00:00:53.395 --> 00:00:59.540
LocationController.Java and this is where I add my own custom response messages.

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.504
So notice here at the controller level on line 17 through 21,

00:01:04.504 --> 00:01:06.859
I'm adding in custom messages.

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:10.010
So for 400 error message,

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.030
I'm saying this is a bad request,

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.165
please follow the API documentation for the proper request format.

00:01:16.165 --> 00:01:18.470
I'm doing the same thing for 401.

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:21.859
I'm providing a custom error message and for 500,

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:24.290
I'm providing a custom error message.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.245
So now let's navigate to the swagger UI.

00:01:27.245 --> 00:01:30.605
I've already deployed the application and it's up and running.

00:01:30.605 --> 00:01:32.750
So here's the swagger UI.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.435
Let's look at our location controller and let's click on this operation.

00:01:38.435 --> 00:01:41.629
Now notice along with the 200 code,

00:01:41.629 --> 00:01:48.379
we have the three custom responses that I've provided for 400, 401, and 500.

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:54.329
So this is a look at how you can customize error messages coming from your APIs.
