00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
Today we reviewed swagger,

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.849
which dynamically generates documentation from your Java code.

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:12.029
We saw how useful the swagger UI is by allowing other APIs developers or consumers

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:14.820
to interact with your APIs resources

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.585
without having any of their implementation logic in place.

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:21.208
We wrapped up by discussing how to customize

00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:24.419
the response messages using swagger annotations.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.130
Next, I will teach you about unit and integration testing for your APIs.
