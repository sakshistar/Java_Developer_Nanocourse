00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
In this lesson, we'll learn about logging.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.555
Logs can be an extremely important aspect to your web environment.

00:00:06.554 --> 00:00:09.029
They provide you with additional information that can be

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:12.059
used for debugging as well as information on purposes.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.269
Let's look at this enterprise application diagram.

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.714
The enterprise application has

00:00:17.714 --> 00:00:23.519
a diagnostic element which can be used for deriving some meaningful information.

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.164
What I mean by this is,

00:00:25.164 --> 00:00:27.980
let's say that we have an e-commerce application,

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.570
and we want to find out how many users hit

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.909
your application or how many user requests hit a particular API that you have created,

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:43.339
and want to find out the transactions or the number of requests that were hit per second.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.620
That is a piece of information that you can obtain using logs.

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:52.144
This element that you see over here is nothing but

00:00:52.145 --> 00:00:55.125
a logging service which writes the logs

00:00:55.125 --> 00:00:59.869
into file system or other systems that can then be

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:05.609
used for deriving meaningful information about your application.
