00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.190
Here is a recommended reading that I have provided to you,

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.019
which is the manual for SLF4J.

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.015
Let me quickly go ahead and show this document to you.

00:00:12.015 --> 00:00:16.155
So I had the SLF4J user manual open for you here.

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:19.320
A lot of developers do not go through this information,

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:27.600
and that is something that limits them to only use Log4J or the framework to an extent.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.730
Now if you read through this,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.410
this is definitely going to put you in

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.115
the 20 percent of the developers that go through this manual,

00:00:35.115 --> 00:00:39.140
and know more of how to use SLF4J in general.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.609
If you look at this,

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:43.924
it talks about typical usage pattern,

00:00:43.924 --> 00:00:49.504
and this line of code is how you would include

00:00:49.505 --> 00:00:56.635
a logger into any class that you want to write or create a logger for or write into.

00:00:56.634 --> 00:00:59.769
This also talks about the logging APIs.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.689
I would leave this document for you under the video so that you can spend some time and

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:07.549
get yourself familiarized with

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.390
different kinds of logging frameworks that you can use apart from Log4J,

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.849
like Logback and Java.Util.Logging.
