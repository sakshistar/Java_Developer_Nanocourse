00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.469
Now, a lot of times I hear a conversation about SLF4J versus Log4j.

00:00:06.469 --> 00:00:09.650
The main purpose of SLF4J which stands for

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.339
Simple Logging Facade for Java is to provide an logging abstraction,

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.879
which is helpful to decouple your application from

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:21.960
the underlying logging or the underlying logger.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.190
So at runtime you can provide the actual implementer

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.720
and Log4j is a VAT logging framework implementation.

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:35.729
The other forms of implementation could be Logback or

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:38.729
Java.Util.Logging that you can also use

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:42.779
in order to include logging into your application.
