00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.559
Let's try to use some logs on the UserController class.

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:07.889
Now, the first thing that I would do for that is I would get

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:12.105
the Maven dependencies that are needed for SLR 4G.

00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:17.054
So let me just look for that.

00:00:17.054 --> 00:00:19.980
Okay. Now I see a lot of

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.490
these dependencies and the one that I'm going to use is this one which is

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:29.820
SLF4G 12 Binding and I'm going to use this one since it has more usages.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.414
I just copied it and I'm going to paste that in my pom.

00:00:35.414 --> 00:00:40.740
So here's my dependency and I'm going to remove the scope from test so that it can be

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.935
used in the other classes as well and is not confined to just the test class.

00:00:45.935 --> 00:00:50.375
Now let's try to add some logs into the UserController class.

00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:56.585
First, we'll start with identifying a place where I can add some logs.

00:00:56.585 --> 00:00:59.195
So before I do that,

00:00:59.195 --> 00:01:09.319
let me get the object which is log and I'll check out all the options that are available.

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:12.679
So you can see all the different levels of

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.984
logging available under the object and which is debug,

00:01:16.983 --> 00:01:22.804
error, info, and trace as well worn.

00:01:22.805 --> 00:01:32.490
So this info is something that you would use a lot in your application.

00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:37.009
This is like your eyes and ears for the application.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.350
So let's say that I want to print the get username so

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:48.094
that every time username is set into the user object I know what is that value.

00:01:48.094 --> 00:01:52.700
So I'm going to create a log line and let me

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.105
move it to here so that I can see what's going on here.

00:01:58.105 --> 00:02:01.385
I would say get user request.

00:02:01.385 --> 00:02:05.795
Okay. I'm going to say something in simple English,

00:02:05.795 --> 00:02:10.840
User name set with this value,

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.759
because that's what happened at line 53.

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:20.644
Great. So this is how we added one info logline into the application.

00:02:20.645 --> 00:02:23.555
So when this application runs,

00:02:23.555 --> 00:02:27.405
every time this particular piece of code is encountered,

00:02:27.405 --> 00:02:32.074
this line of code with the value for get username is going to be printed.

00:02:32.074 --> 00:02:39.274
So you would know what was the username set at every single time, createUser was called.

00:02:39.275 --> 00:02:41.539
Now that's how you would add logging to

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:44.389
the e-commerce application that we created together.

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:48.319
Feel free to add as many logs as you think you want to

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.739
add into the application and start to look at the log files.
