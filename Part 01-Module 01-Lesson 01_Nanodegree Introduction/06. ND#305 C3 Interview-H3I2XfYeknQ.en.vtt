00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
My name is Arvindon.

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.575
I work as a software engineer at Netflix.

00:00:04.575 --> 00:00:08.235
I work on the infrastructure for Netflix's media pipeline.

00:00:08.235 --> 00:00:11.100
This course is aimed at anyone who wants to

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.280
build production quality applications using Java.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.340
You should take this course because it covers a broad range of

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.180
topics that a developer needs to know in their day-to-day jobs.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.720
The one piece of information that I would tell about this course is,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.530
it not only teaches you how to develop applications using Java,

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.640
but it also teaches you how to build and deploy them.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.144
When recruiting a Java developer,

00:00:35.144 --> 00:00:38.405
the hiring managers look for someone who can write

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:43.235
APIs and who has experience working with multiple data stores.

00:00:43.235 --> 00:00:46.145
All of these skills are taught in this course.

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:49.520
You should focus on your GitHub portfolio because it

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.135
lets you demonstrate your coding skills to a hiring manager.

00:00:53.135 --> 00:00:57.515
At Netflix, I build applications that have an API to interact with

00:00:57.515 --> 00:01:01.550
other applications and they also store data in multiple data stores.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.655
The most rewarding thing for me is the constant learning.

00:01:04.655 --> 00:01:07.310
The learning never stops in this field.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.710
When you enter this field,

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.670
you will most likely be in a team of

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.080
6-8 software engineers working on a fun and a challenging project.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.060
I love Udacity because they teach

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.275
practical skills that are in demand in today's job market.

00:01:20.275 --> 00:01:22.910
This course is fantastic because it teaches you

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.210
all the skills to be productive on the first day of the job.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.320
Since Java is mostly used in building server-side applications,

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.185
a Java developer would typically be building

00:01:33.185 --> 00:01:37.130
applications that need to scale to a large number of users.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.340
Be curious and always be open to new ideas.
