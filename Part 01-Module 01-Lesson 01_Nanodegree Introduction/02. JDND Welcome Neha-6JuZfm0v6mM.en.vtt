Welcome to Java Developer Nanodegree program.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.490
Hi, my name is Neha Garg,

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.055
and I'm a Product Lead here at Udacity.

00:00:08.055 --> 00:00:11.280
I have worked with a great team of industry experts and

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.580
curriculum designers to put this Nanodegree program together,

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.625
and I'm very excited to have you join us.

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:19.380
Java has been one of

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.190
the most popular programming languages in the world for over 20 years.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.980
Ninety percent of the Fortune 500 companies rely on Java for their back-end architecture.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.830
Many products you use daily from Uber,

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.165
Netflix, LinkedIn, are all running on Java.

00:00:35.165 --> 00:00:38.375
In this program, you'll learn to build, test,

00:00:38.375 --> 00:00:42.970
and deploy back-end infrastructure for various apps using Java.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.100
You'll be able to share these real-world projects with

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.220
current or prospective employers to demonstrate

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.420
mastery of the skills that are in high demand at all companies.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.205
You'll work on variety of products such as a chatroom application with Spring Boot,

00:00:59.205 --> 00:01:01.575
a back-end system for a car website,

00:01:01.575 --> 00:01:05.070
and an authorization for an E-commerce application.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.935
You'll learn from instructors who have

00:01:06.935 --> 00:01:10.474
extensive experience building large-scale back-end infrastructure

00:01:10.474 --> 00:01:13.640
in companies such as Google, Netflix, and Walmart.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.820
As a result, skills you'll learn in this program are directly

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.195
applicable to what Java developers do at the job.

00:01:20.195 --> 00:01:22.655
Every project you submit gets reviewed,

00:01:22.655 --> 00:01:24.545
and our project reviewers will provide you

00:01:24.545 --> 00:01:27.440
personalized feedback on how you can improve your work.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.930
These projects will serve as a portfolio you can use to demonstrate your skills.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.580
After you complete the program,

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.995
you'll be ready for a Java developer role

00:01:36.995 --> 00:01:39.905
or bring these crucial skills to your current role.

00:01:39.905 --> 00:01:45.300
We are excited and honored that you are taking this step in your journey with us.
