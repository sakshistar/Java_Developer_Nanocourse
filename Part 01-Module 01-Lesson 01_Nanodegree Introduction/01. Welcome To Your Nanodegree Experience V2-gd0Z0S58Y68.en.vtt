00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.435
If this is your first Nanodegree program, you start here.

00:00:03.435 --> 00:00:06.450
If you've taken a Nanodegree program with us before,

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.775
you already know a little bit of what to expect.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:12.435
Udacity is always improving our learning experience for students.

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:16.290
So you can watch this to see what has changed or you can skip ahead.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.995
You can also download the transcript of this video in the resources tab.

00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:22.380
Let's get started. We truly believe that

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.750
you couldn't have chosen a better place to learn.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.030
A lot of people have worked tirelessly to create

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.240
the course material and platform features,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.875
as we all want you to get the most of your learning journey.

00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:34.680
Our pledge is to provide you with resources and

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.565
services that will further enable you to succeed in your Nanodegree program.

00:00:38.565 --> 00:00:40.120
As you go through the lessons,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.090
you may find some to be difficult and may feel discouraged.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.010
If this happens, we encourage you to take advantage of

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.715
your community channels and mentor services to help clarify the concepts,

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:51.065
or just to share your doubts.

00:00:51.065 --> 00:00:53.150
Our mentors are there to help you.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.400
You will get advice and guidance to ensure

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.740
that you are on track to complete the projects.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.700
We want you to succeed and graduate with the Udacity Nanodegree certificate.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.585
We value the trust you have put in us by making this investment in your future career.

00:01:05.585 --> 00:01:08.090
We take it very seriously and we're here to help

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.460
you achieve whatever you came here to accomplish.
