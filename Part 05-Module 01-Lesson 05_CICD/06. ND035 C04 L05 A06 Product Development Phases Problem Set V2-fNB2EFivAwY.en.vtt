00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
Now let's go ahead and create the entire CIC,

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.190
the pipeline and learn how

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.150
the technologies that we have introduced so far work with each other.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.400
So for this part of the lesson,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.505
I'm going to spin up an AWS instance.

00:00:14.505 --> 00:00:17.490
I'm also going to create a Docker image,

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:23.140
I'm going to have the jenkins pipeline setup and in order to start the pipeline,

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.339
we will have a trigger set from a Git commit.

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:29.429
Let's see how they work together.

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.575
Let's start with the first step which is spinning up an AWS Instance.

00:00:34.575 --> 00:00:38.990
The screen you see right now is my account where I have an Instance running.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.859
However, I'm going to start with a brand new Instance.

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:45.619
For doing that, all you have to do is login to

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:51.644
your AWS account which is nothing but aws.amazon.com,

00:00:51.645 --> 00:00:53.580
and you go into My Account.

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.774
You should have a sign-in option.

00:00:55.774 --> 00:00:57.905
So you can go ahead and sign into it.

00:00:57.905 --> 00:00:59.420
I'm already logged in.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.810
So I would be on the screen.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.579
Once you have logged in,

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:08.269
you can go to the Launch instance section and click on this drop-down,

00:01:08.269 --> 00:01:15.024
which gives you the option of Launch instance which is going to spin up an AWS Instance.

00:01:15.025 --> 00:01:18.540
Now, here, you would have multiple options.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.984
So you have Amazon Linux,

00:01:20.984 --> 00:01:28.859
Linux was at this configuration and Red Hat and several other options.

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:32.280
Since I'm trying to keep it in the free tier,

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.599
I'm going to take a look at the free tier eligible options.

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:44.859
My choice amongst the options available here is Amazon Linux AMI 2018.03.0.

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:47.840
The reason why I chose this particular configuration is because

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.034
this repository includes Docker.

00:01:51.034 --> 00:01:53.814
So let me choose this.

00:01:53.814 --> 00:01:56.039
I'm going to keep it to the default,

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:03.605
which is general purpose T2 micro and I'm going to click ''Configure Instance''.

00:02:03.605 --> 00:02:05.660
So here I'm going to stick to the default

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.134
again which is at the Configure Instance Details,

00:02:09.134 --> 00:02:13.449
I am going to click the next option and I'm going to stick to the default again,

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:21.375
and I'm going to collect these options which is our tags.

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:23.159
I'm going to keep the default.

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:28.099
In this section, I'm going to create a security group.

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:34.269
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to add a new rule,

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.530
and I'm going to keep accustomed TCP.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.525
The port that I'm going to add is going to be

00:02:41.525 --> 00:02:48.700
8080 and I'm going to keep the rest of the options as default.

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:52.464
Next, I'm going to click ''Review Launch''.

00:02:52.465 --> 00:02:56.870
So I have kept everything as default and I'm going to keep

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.870
the custom TCP rule with the port range of 8080

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.605
since Jenkins needs that and I'm going to Launch this.

00:03:03.604 --> 00:03:06.694
On clicking Launch, it gives me an option to choose

00:03:06.694 --> 00:03:10.234
a key pair and I'm going to create a new key pair.

00:03:10.235 --> 00:03:14.510
Let me name this as jenkins.

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:19.655
So now I have the pem file and then I'm going to launch it.

00:03:19.655 --> 00:03:25.310
So now it gives me this success message which says your instance is now launching.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.455
Once this is up and running,

00:03:27.455 --> 00:03:31.700
I'll be able to see the launched instance on my admin page.

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:35.060
So the next thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to give

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.604
more permissions to this file that I just downloaded for my key pair.

00:03:39.604 --> 00:03:43.564
Let me go ahead and do that, and this has downloaded to my downloads.

00:03:43.564 --> 00:03:46.414
So I'm going to open a new window here.

00:03:46.414 --> 00:03:50.525
So this is the file that I'm trying to give permissions to.

00:03:50.525 --> 00:03:53.900
I am going to do that right now.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.245
So now I'm going to login to the AWS Instance and that would have started already.

00:04:00.245 --> 00:04:02.015
Let me go ahead and check that.

00:04:02.014 --> 00:04:04.669
So on this screen, as you see,

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:09.284
it says there's a falling Instance launches had been initiated and that is the Instance.

00:04:09.284 --> 00:04:13.145
You can take a look at the launched logs as well.

00:04:13.145 --> 00:04:15.230
I'm going to take a look at all the Instances.

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:21.139
Now, I have the Instance that I was trying to run before and it still says initializing.

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.490
However, I will be able to login to this.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.680
So I have this IP and there are various ways I can connect to this.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.275
In order to connect to this Instance,

00:04:32.274 --> 00:04:34.699
I could use any of these options.

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.870
Since I have already given the permission to

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.449
this file that I just downloaded and it clearly mentioned it over here,

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.909
I'm going to have this command run

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.170
to connect to this particular Instance which I have running.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.225
So I just copied it.

00:04:53.225 --> 00:04:58.564
So now I'm logged into the AWS Instance that I just started.

00:04:58.564 --> 00:05:02.449
What I'm going to do next is I'm going to install Docker here.

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:07.539
So the command to do that is yum install Docker.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.500
This just informs me that this is

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.610
the total download size and the installed size and do I think it's okay.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.360
So I'm going to allow it.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.449
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to add a user group to Docker.

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:26.435
So this is the command to add a user group to Docker..

00:05:26.435 --> 00:05:28.959
The next thing that I'm going to do is I'm going

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:35.724
to log out of this machine or this Instance and then I'm going to log back in.

00:05:35.725 --> 00:05:44.310
So let's go to the Instance that is

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.500
running and I'm going to click ''Connect'' again and I'm going to repeat

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.675
the same step which is copy this particular command and run that.

00:05:53.675 --> 00:05:57.410
So now I'm logged into the same Instance again.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.435
I'm ready to start Docker here.

00:05:59.435 --> 00:06:05.405
So the next instruction that I'm going to add here is going to be also available to you.

00:06:05.404 --> 00:06:08.254
I'm going to add that right now.

00:06:08.254 --> 00:06:12.094
So what this would do is it would run the Docker image.

00:06:12.095 --> 00:06:17.090
So what it provided to me right now is the container ID for the Docker image.

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:21.768
So next what I'm going to do is I'm going to open a shell into jenkins

00:06:21.769 --> 00:06:27.329
and to do that I'm going to run this command.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.495
Now that I am there,

00:06:30.495 --> 00:06:33.149
I'm going to install Maven here.

00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:38.054
So the next thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to generate SSH keys,

00:06:38.055 --> 00:06:40.889
and I'm not entering any passphrase.

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:46.904
So this created my SSH keys at root.

00:06:46.904 --> 00:06:50.909
This successfully created my public and private key and they are now

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:55.035
stored in my SSH folder.

00:06:55.035 --> 00:07:01.665
Let's go ahead and now go to the running instance of Jenkins.

00:07:01.665 --> 00:07:09.765
What I would do now is I'm going to go to the AWS instance,

00:07:09.764 --> 00:07:16.334
and I'm going to 8080 port where I have Jenkins running,

00:07:16.334 --> 00:07:20.685
and I am going to now add the password,

00:07:20.685 --> 00:07:23.579
and it gives you instructions of where the password store.

00:07:23.579 --> 00:07:27.995
So I'm going to copy the path and go to

00:07:27.995 --> 00:07:36.240
the folder and copy out this password and add it here.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.970
This gives me an option to install

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:42.885
all the suggested plugins which I'm going to say yes to.

00:07:42.884 --> 00:07:49.409
So as you see this gives me an option to install Git plug-in as well.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.920
There are several other plugins that it installs by default.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:56.290
Let's wait until it finishes installation.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.460
I'm now going to create an admin.

00:07:59.459 --> 00:08:03.764
So it gave me the Jenkins URL and now I'm going to save and finish.

00:08:03.764 --> 00:08:07.769
Okay. So now this is the screen,

00:08:07.769 --> 00:08:12.049
the welcome screen for Jenkins and we will go over the configurations over here.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:15.590
But the first thing that I needed to take a look at is the credentials.

00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:19.064
So what I'm going to do is now I'm going to set a global credentials.

00:08:19.064 --> 00:08:24.105
So what do you need to do is I clicked on credentials,

00:08:24.105 --> 00:08:28.905
I'd go to global and adding some credentials.

00:08:28.904 --> 00:08:31.289
So here what I'm going to do is I'm going to look

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:33.519
at the kind and this gives me an option to

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:38.299
SSH username with private key which is what I'm going to choose right now.

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:43.179
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to add a private key here.

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:49.995
I clicked on enter directly and clicked on add and I picked up the private key from here.

00:08:49.995 --> 00:08:54.299
So I have copied this.

00:08:54.299 --> 00:08:57.245
Now I'm going to add this here.

00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:59.629
So I'm just going to add a username.

00:08:59.629 --> 00:09:03.330
So this successfully created my global credential.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:08.870
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to add the public key onto my Git repository.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.419
Let me show you how to do that.

00:09:10.419 --> 00:09:12.995
So here I have my Git repository,

00:09:12.995 --> 00:09:16.685
and here I would add my public key.

00:09:16.684 --> 00:09:19.579
What we're going to do next is you're going to

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.770
choose an application that you're going to deploy to Cloud.

00:09:22.769 --> 00:09:27.509
So for that you can either take the e-commerce application that we

00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:30.399
build or you may choose to use any of

00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:33.679
the applications that you must have built through this entire course.

00:09:33.679 --> 00:09:35.495
I leave that option up to you.

00:09:35.495 --> 00:09:39.440
But for this particular lesson I'm going to deploy the e-commerce application.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.520
So in order to add the public key,

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:43.353
I would go to settings,

00:09:43.354 --> 00:09:47.280
and I'm going to click Deploy keys option here.

00:09:47.279 --> 00:09:51.404
As you see I already have two keys deployed.

00:09:51.404 --> 00:09:55.814
I'm going to add one more key right now and let me just name it

00:09:55.815 --> 00:10:04.860
Jenkins demo and I will pick up the public key right now.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:13.389
So I'm going to cap the public key and copy the public key out,

00:10:13.399 --> 00:10:17.629
and I'm going to paste that into the key section.

00:10:17.629 --> 00:10:20.029
Make sure that you allow write access to it.

00:10:20.029 --> 00:10:22.409
So I've successfully deployed the key now.

00:10:22.409 --> 00:10:25.339
So the entire pipeline is set up.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.735
So now that the entire pipeline is set up,

00:10:27.735 --> 00:10:31.169
let me go ahead and configure the project at Jenkins.

00:10:31.169 --> 00:10:34.064
So now this is the part where I'm going to create a new job

00:10:34.065 --> 00:10:36.940
for Jenkins and I'm going to click on this option,

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:41.360
please create this, and I'm going to choose a Freestyle project option.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:50.320
For this particular project I'm going to name it project demo and I click okay.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.870
So this is the configuration for Jenkins,

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:59.284
and it has all these options which you

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:03.860
could go through in order to understand what different functionalities it offers.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.455
Since we used Git,

00:11:05.455 --> 00:11:07.395
I'm going to choose the Git option,

00:11:07.394 --> 00:11:12.360
and I'm going to add the repository URL over here and the credentials,

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.250
and that would set up the Git linking here.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:19.860
The other thing that I need to do after that is choose

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.810
the branch that I want to run the build on.

00:11:23.809 --> 00:11:25.774
So let me go ahead and do that.

00:11:25.774 --> 00:11:29.764
So I'm going to go to the Git repository,

00:11:29.764 --> 00:11:32.600
and I'm going to copy this,

00:11:32.659 --> 00:11:37.105
and now I'm going to add the repository URL that I just copied,

00:11:37.105 --> 00:11:40.139
and I would add the key.

00:11:40.139 --> 00:11:42.990
So if you had a problem here,

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:45.450
it would throw some error in red.

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:47.520
However, if it was successful,

00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:49.470
it will not show any error.

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:53.009
Now what I want to do is I do not want to run this from

00:11:53.009 --> 00:11:57.149
master or what I want to do is I want to run this from a different branch.

00:11:57.149 --> 00:12:00.259
So I'm going to choose a different branch now.

00:12:00.259 --> 00:12:08.009
So this is basically going to set up the Jenkins pipeline for that particular branch.

00:12:08.009 --> 00:12:14.700
So what I'm going to do next is I'm going to add the palm location at the build step.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:18.575
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to choose the palm location

00:12:18.575 --> 00:12:22.695
now so my palm is a specific project.

00:12:22.695 --> 00:12:28.040
So now I have chosen the exact path for my palm and I'm going to save this,

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:31.875
and this configuration is complete for me.

00:12:31.875 --> 00:12:34.955
What I would do now is trigger a build

00:12:34.955 --> 00:12:38.810
and see if it gives me an error or it builds successfully.

00:12:38.809 --> 00:12:40.274
So to do that,

00:12:40.274 --> 00:12:43.829
what I have to do is click on this build now option.

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.720
So this give me an error.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.629
Let's go check it out and see what was the error.

00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:55.379
So it's some part of the build, download from central.

00:12:55.379 --> 00:12:58.799
So the error here says no goals had been specified

00:12:58.799 --> 00:13:02.299
for this build and it also gives you an information about that.

00:13:02.299 --> 00:13:03.879
Let's go ahead and fix that.

00:13:03.879 --> 00:13:05.120
In order to do that,

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.590
what I'm going to do is I'm going to set the goals.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:12.769
So for that let's go to configure again and as you see,

00:13:12.769 --> 00:13:14.329
I've already fixed it,

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.245
but let me just show you what the fix was.

00:13:17.245 --> 00:13:23.350
So the goals is available at the pack,

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:26.725
the build level, so we finished adding

00:13:26.725 --> 00:13:31.129
the palm and what I had missed was adding the goals here.

00:13:31.129 --> 00:13:33.945
So I added that best package over here,

00:13:33.945 --> 00:13:35.710
and I saved it,

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:40.470
and then when I go ahead and trigger another build,

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:45.620
it goes through the entire process of building,

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:48.144
and let's trace the logs now.

00:13:48.144 --> 00:13:51.284
So this time the build was successful.

00:13:51.284 --> 00:13:59.799
Now this means that every time now I make some commits or some changes to my fork,

00:13:59.799 --> 00:14:03.694
and then I merge it into the master,

00:14:03.695 --> 00:14:12.490
it will trigger an automatic build that is going to be triggering this Jenkins pipeline.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:16.159
So that's it for Jenkins.
