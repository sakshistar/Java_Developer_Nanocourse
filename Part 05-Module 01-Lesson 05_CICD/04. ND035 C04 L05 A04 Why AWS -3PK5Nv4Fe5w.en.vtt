00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320
In my previous lesson,

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.759
I have spoken about AWS at length.

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:09.554
I had also spoken about why AWS is doing extremely well in the market these days.

00:00:09.554 --> 00:00:12.719
It's definitely faring much better than its competitors

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.140
like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.460
But it's always a good idea to go over and compare all

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.830
of these three to understand the subtle differences between each of them,

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.320
and see which one has the advantages over the other,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.820
especially for your project,

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.579
because no solution is the perfect solution.
