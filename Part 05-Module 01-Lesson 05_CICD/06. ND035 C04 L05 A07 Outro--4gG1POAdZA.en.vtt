00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.345
With that, we were able to set up the Jenkins pipeline.

00:00:03.345 --> 00:00:09.060
We already linked our Git repository to Jenkins to build our application.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.060
The next step ideally would be to go ahead

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.540
and deploy the build to a particular environment.

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:17.655
In an enterprise setup,

00:00:17.655 --> 00:00:21.510
you would have or you would be given an infrastructure environment,

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.060
like Dev or Stage or production environment where the build gets deployed.

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:31.589
If you're interested I'm going to provide the steps to have your build

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:36.094
deployed to an environment so that you can go ahead and explore that option, too.

00:00:36.094 --> 00:00:37.839
For this particular course,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.090
we have been able to successfully build the application on Jenkins.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.400
So I hope you learned a lot from this example and you're able to set

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:52.060
up your application and get that build on your system as well.
