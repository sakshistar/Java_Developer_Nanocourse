00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.769
Let's also look into the next technology which is Jenkins.

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:09.379
I am going to list this official website of Jenkins for you,

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.580
and make it available for you under the video.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:19.905
Let's look at why Jenkins happens to be the most popular CICD tool.

00:00:19.905 --> 00:00:25.230
So Jenkins happens to be an extremely popular tool for CICD,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.710
and that is because of the fact that a lot of companies use Jenkins.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.160
It also has a lot of tutorials and a lot of help available online.

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:43.699
Apart from that, it has a lot of plugins available that make it extremely

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.580
configurable with different types of pipeline that you're

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.059
trying to create by using different technologies.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.840
So for example, for the sake of this lesson,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.155
if I am trying to build a pipeline using Docker, Maven,

00:00:57.155 --> 00:01:03.575
and AWS, you could have a node application with Kubernetes or other technologies,

00:01:03.575 --> 00:01:05.825
and you'll be able to deploy it in Azure.

00:01:05.825 --> 00:01:11.390
Jenkins plays very well with any combination that you choose.
