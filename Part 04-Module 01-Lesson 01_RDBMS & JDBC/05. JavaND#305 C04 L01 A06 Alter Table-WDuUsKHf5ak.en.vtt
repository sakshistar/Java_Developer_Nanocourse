00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.129
Let's see how we can modify the structure of a table after it has been created.

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:07.719
In the Orders Table,

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:13.125
one important piece of information is missing.

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:16.035
We do not know who placed this order.

00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:18.960
Let's add the customer information to the order table.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.730
We need to add two columns;

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.969
one for the name and one for the address of the customer.

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:31.254
To modify a table,

00:00:31.254 --> 00:00:33.500
we'll use the alter table statement.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.159
The alter table is followed by the table name that we want to

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:41.369
modify and the modification that we want to do,

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:46.384
which is, we want to add a column in this case followed by the column name.

00:00:46.384 --> 00:00:49.189
I'm going to add the name column first.

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:50.960
I'm going to call it customer name.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.950
Then, we need to specify the data type and if there are any constraints.

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:01.559
I want to specify the length as 255 characters and

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.159
the constraint I'm just going to set it as null.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.430
All right. Now that column got added.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.360
Let's go ahead and add the address column as well.

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:17.914
Instead of customer name,

00:01:17.915 --> 00:01:20.365
I'm going to call it as customer address,

00:01:20.364 --> 00:01:22.545
and since address could be longer.

00:01:22.545 --> 00:01:26.359
I'm just going to double the size to 510 characters.

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:29.105
I'm keeping the constraints the same.

00:01:29.105 --> 00:01:31.160
Let's add this column.

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.539
Now let's see whether the Orders Table has been modified.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:44.650
It is. You can see the newly added customer name and customer address columns here.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:51.000
That's how you alter the definition of a table after it has been created.
