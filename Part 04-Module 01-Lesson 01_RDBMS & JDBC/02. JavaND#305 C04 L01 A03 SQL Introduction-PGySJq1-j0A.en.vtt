00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.395
In an earlier topic,

00:00:01.395 --> 00:00:05.789
we briefly touched on Structured Query Language or SQL.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.039
SQL is the primary interface used to interact with relational databases.

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:15.809
SQL is a declarative domain specific language that

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.774
is purposefully designed for managing data held in a relational database.

00:00:20.774 --> 00:00:23.054
Let's break that definition down.

00:00:23.054 --> 00:00:25.289
What does declarative mean?

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.280
Declarative languages describe the desired results,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.009
but don't explicitly list commands or

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.774
steps that must be performed to achieve those results.

00:00:35.774 --> 00:00:38.734
Before I delve deeper into the term declarative,

00:00:38.734 --> 00:00:42.750
let's see how a typical programming language works.

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:46.549
In an imperative language like Java,

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:51.094
lets say if you need to read 10 lines of text from a file,

00:00:51.094 --> 00:00:55.054
you will write code to open a file handle,

00:00:55.054 --> 00:01:00.780
then use an iterator that reads 10 lines using that file handle,

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.250
then close the file handle.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.120
See that you're specifying all the steps that need to be performed to

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.300
achieve your desired result which is read 10 lines from a file.

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.750
In SQL, if you want to read ten rows from a table,

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.905
you simply provide your intention in the form of a statement like this. That's it.

00:01:23.905 --> 00:01:26.599
The Database figures out the best steps to

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:29.509
get the 10 rows from the table and returns it to you.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.390
Simple, right? Let's look at the other term.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.814
Domain-specific that was in the definition.

00:01:35.814 --> 00:01:39.620
SQL is not a general purpose programming language.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.375
Meaning you can't use SQL to build a web or mobile applications.

00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:48.170
It is designed for one purpose and one purpose only.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.989
That is, to interact with a relational database.
