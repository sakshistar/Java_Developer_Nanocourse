00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.710
Nice job on installing and setting up MySQL.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.310
Now, you're going to learn how to create a table in MySQL.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.690
We'll be using the MySQL client to execute our SQL statements.

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:14.939
Let's assume you are a developer in

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:18.719
an e-commerce application and you're building the persistence layer for it.

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:23.835
The basic function of this application is to allow customers to buy items.

00:00:23.835 --> 00:00:29.170
Let's go ahead and create a table to capture the ordered information.

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:36.469
Here's the create table statement to create an order table.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.009
Create table as it says, creates a table.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.800
It is followed by the table name and a set of

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:51.469
column definitions and the constraint that is imposed on the table.

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.619
The only constraint on this table is that

00:00:54.619 --> 00:01:01.099
the order ID column is the primary key or the unique identifier for a row.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.745
Column definitions have the column name,

00:01:04.745 --> 00:01:06.685
the data type of the column,

00:01:06.685 --> 00:01:11.775
and a qualifier or a constraint like this.

00:01:11.775 --> 00:01:16.075
The quantifier for order ID is auto increment,

00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:18.920
which tells the database to automatically

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.439
increment the values of the column upon each insertion.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.954
Item name, for example,

00:01:26.954 --> 00:01:33.829
has the type as VARCHAR which is 300 characters long and its constraint is not null,

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:38.554
which means whenever a record is inserted into the order table,

00:01:38.555 --> 00:01:42.320
a value for item name must be present.

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:45.989
Let's go ahead and create this table.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.939
Our table has created.

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.090
Let's see if this table was actually created.

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:58.894
Okay, we see one table which is Orders.

00:01:58.894 --> 00:02:02.109
Let's examine the table structure.

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:11.360
All right, so you have all the columns that was defined in

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.090
the original create table definition listed over

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.229
here and then we can see all the data types,

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:19.234
the constraints that we have added.

00:02:19.235 --> 00:02:26.045
Note that ORDER_ID was set as the primary key and it is marked as the primary key here.

00:02:26.044 --> 00:02:29.084
The qualifiers is also marked here,

00:02:29.085 --> 00:02:31.629
which is auto increment.
