00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.069
Congratulations.

00:00:02.069 --> 00:00:04.859
You've finished the first lesson of this course.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.320
We've covered a lot of ground in this lesson.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.960
Let's recap what we have learned so far.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.554
First, you started with the basics of relational databases and SQL.

00:00:15.554 --> 00:00:19.829
Then, you learned how to install and set up MySQL.

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:24.644
You use the MySQL client to send SQL statements to the database.

00:00:24.644 --> 00:00:27.660
You learned the fundamentals of JDBC and

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.914
the contracts that it provides to access the database.

00:00:30.914 --> 00:00:37.634
You used JDBC's DriverManager and connection classes to connect to a MySQL database.

00:00:37.634 --> 00:00:44.004
You executed SQL queries using statement and process the results using ResultsSet.

00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:50.570
Finally, you learned about database migrations and how to do them using Flyway.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.399
In the next lesson,

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.704
you will learn how to simplify database interactions even further

00:00:56.704 --> 00:01:02.429
and make your code more flexible using the Java Persistence API.
