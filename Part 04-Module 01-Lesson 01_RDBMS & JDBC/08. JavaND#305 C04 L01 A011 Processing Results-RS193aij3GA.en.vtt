00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
Now we have a connection to the database.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.640
We executed a SQL query,

00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:07.259
and it's time to process the results.

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.844
The results are held in a result set object.

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:15.945
A result set object maintains a cursor pointing to its current row of data.

00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:20.460
Initially, the cursor is positioned just before the first row.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.315
The next method moves the cursor to the next row.

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:29.370
Because it returns false when there are no more rows in the result set object,

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.289
it can be used inside a while loop to iterate through the results set.

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:40.515
Needless to say, the result set object should also be wrapped in a try-block.

00:00:40.515 --> 00:00:42.200
Inside the while loop,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.365
we can use the corresponding get method for the column type to read its value.

00:00:48.365 --> 00:00:50.900
We know that orderID is an integer.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.850
So we use getInt.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.399
Customer Name is a wildcard,

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.250
which translates to a string in Java.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.094
So we use getString.

00:01:00.094 --> 00:01:05.784
You can also read column values by their index in the query.

00:01:05.784 --> 00:01:10.509
Let's see if it prints the ID and the name.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.100
It did. We can exit to MySQL,

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:24.179
executed the SQL query and, process the results.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.060
We have now completed the three basic steps of database interactions.
