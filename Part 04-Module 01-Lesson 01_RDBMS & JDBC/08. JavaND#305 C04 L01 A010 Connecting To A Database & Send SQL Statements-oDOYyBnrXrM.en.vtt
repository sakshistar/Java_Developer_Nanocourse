00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960
Let's see how we can use Driver Manager to connect to the database.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.515
This is a simple class with a main method.

00:00:08.515 --> 00:00:11.440
The get connection method establishes

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:15.535
a database connection and it requires a database URL.

00:00:15.535 --> 00:00:17.589
The database URL contains

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:22.464
all the relevant information necessary to establish a connection.

00:00:22.464 --> 00:00:27.515
First, it specifies what type of database that we're connecting to.

00:00:27.515 --> 00:00:32.145
MySQL, where the database server is located.

00:00:32.145 --> 00:00:37.330
Localhost, if the server is running on a port other than the default port,

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.254
you would specify the port number here.

00:00:40.255 --> 00:00:43.770
The database we are connecting to Course 3.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.990
It also specifies the username and the password.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.800
Using the database type the driver manager selects

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:56.309
the appropriate driver from the class bath and obtains a connection.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.340
An important thing to note,

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.665
connection is wrapped in a try with resources block.

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:07.189
So it's closed once the block exists.

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.319
Connections must be closed after use.

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:15.279
Let's run this class to connect to MySQL.

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:19.530
Connected to MySQL.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.570
Nice. We now have a connection to the MySQL database using

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:29.239
the connection object let's create a statement to send SQL queries to the database.

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:32.554
The create statement creates a statement object.

00:01:32.555 --> 00:01:38.210
The execute query sends the SQL query to the database and returns the results.

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:41.599
Note that the statement object is also wrapped in

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:46.669
a try-with-resources block since it must be closed after use.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.150
Let's run this class to see if the query is executed.

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.554
It does but we're not using the results of the query.

00:01:59.555 --> 00:02:02.370
Let's do that in the next video.
