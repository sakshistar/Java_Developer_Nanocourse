Hi. Welcome to course three, Datastores and persistence.

00:00:04.764 --> 00:00:08.455
My name is [inaudible] , I am a software engineer at Netflix.

00:00:08.455 --> 00:00:10.120
For the past 15 years,

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:14.064
I've built many different kinds of applications using Java.

00:00:14.064 --> 00:00:17.394
It is my pleasure to be your instructor for this course.

00:00:17.394 --> 00:00:21.219
Today, I'm going to be teaching you how to choose a Datastore

00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:26.059
and use it to build the persistence layer for your Java applications.

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:32.109
Data persistence is an essential component of every application.

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:36.954
Some applications are built just to manage certain types of data.

00:00:36.954 --> 00:00:40.420
Choosing the right Datastore for your applications is one of

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.545
the most important decisions that you will make as a developer.

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:49.655
For some applications, the Datastore drives the design and architecture.

00:00:49.655 --> 00:00:55.804
In this course, you're going to learn about both relational and non-relational databases.

00:00:55.804 --> 00:01:01.015
Non-relational databases are commonly known as NoSQL databases,

00:01:01.015 --> 00:01:05.060
relational databases best-fit applications where the structure

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.245
of data is known beforehand and doesn't change often.

00:01:09.245 --> 00:01:12.500
Non-relational databases on the other hand are suited for

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.489
applications that deal with unstructured data.

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:19.129
There are various other differences between these databases,

00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:24.379
but this is one of the primary reasons developers choose one or the other.

00:01:24.379 --> 00:01:28.054
This lesson focuses on relational databases.

00:01:28.055 --> 00:01:31.140
There are many relational databases in the market.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.200
For this course, we will be using MySQL,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.870
one of the most popular and widely used relational database.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.255
Like most other relational databases,

00:01:41.254 --> 00:01:46.993
MySQL uses the structured query language or SQL to define,

00:01:46.993 --> 00:01:50.219
update, and query the database.

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:53.944
You will install MySQL in your local workstation

00:01:53.944 --> 00:01:57.589
and set up a database that will be used throughout this course.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.829
You will also learn basic SQL statements to perform,

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.599
create, read, update, and delete operations.

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:12.794
Note that teaching all the features of MySQL is beyond the boundaries of this course.

00:02:12.794 --> 00:02:15.789
You will learn just enough features to use

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:18.819
MySQL for your application's persistence layer.

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.569
Next, you will write Java programs that interact with

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.414
MySQL using an API called Java database connectivity,

00:02:27.414 --> 00:02:30.429
more commonly referred as JDBC.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.000
You will use JDBC to connect to MySQL,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.205
send SQL statements to it,

00:02:36.205 --> 00:02:39.250
and processes the results of those statements.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.169
Later in the lesson,

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:45.479
you will learn how JDBC makes it easy to switch to a different database.

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:49.049
A lot of the code that you will write can be used as

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.700
is to interact with the different database like Postgres.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:00.844
Next, you will get introduced to database migrations and why they are important.

00:03:00.844 --> 00:03:07.175
You will use a library called flyway to set up and run migrations.

00:03:07.175 --> 00:03:09.469
Last but not least,

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:12.770
we'll be using Spring Boot as our application framework.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.510
All of the glucode necessary for a Spring Boot application will be provided,

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:21.949
and you will only write the database interaction portion of the application.

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:27.250
We'll also use Maven to assist us in compiling.
