00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.884
MySQL uses a client-server model.

00:00:03.884 --> 00:00:05.790
In a real-world application,

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.065
MySQL will be running on a different machine than the application.

00:00:10.064 --> 00:00:13.844
The application uses a client to interact with the server.

00:00:13.845 --> 00:00:16.019
For the purpose of this course,

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:20.504
MySQL will be running as a separate process on your local workstation.

00:00:20.504 --> 00:00:24.794
Your application will access the data in the server through the network.

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:27.660
Please take some time to complete the exercise

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.600
of installing MySQL in your local workstation.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.109
You need a working installation to finish the rest of this course.
