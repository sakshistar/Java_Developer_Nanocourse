00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.615
Now that you've learned a little bit about string concatenation,

00:00:02.615 --> 00:00:05.640
try to predict what this program would output.

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:08.844
Follow the program step by step and make sure you're

00:00:08.845 --> 00:00:12.150
updating the values of the variables as they change.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.435
Remember that toLowerCase and toUpperCase commands,

00:00:15.435 --> 00:00:20.085
update the variable inside the string to either become all lowercases,

00:00:20.085 --> 00:00:23.045
which is just small letters or toUpperCases,

00:00:23.045 --> 00:00:24.930
which is all capital letters.

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.059
Which of those outputs would be the correct output from this program?
