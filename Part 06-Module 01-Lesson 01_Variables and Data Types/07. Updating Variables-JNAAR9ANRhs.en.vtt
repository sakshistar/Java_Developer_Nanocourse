00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.674
Now that we've declared an initialized variable,

00:00:03.674 --> 00:00:07.889
let's see how we can use it to keep track of the number of people on a bus.

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:13.349
Say our bus starts by picking up five more passengers at the first stop.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.695
This basically means we want to add five to our passengers variable here.

00:00:17.695 --> 00:00:22.995
One thing we can do with variables is update it by building on its old value.

00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:25.530
This is done by writing the variable name,

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.203
and then an equal sign,

00:00:27.202 --> 00:00:28.794
and then the variable name again,

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:33.054
and then plus whatever value we want to add to it.

00:00:33.054 --> 00:00:35.700
Now, when you look at a statement like this,

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.859
it might seem weird at first.

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:41.250
How can passengers be equal to passengers plus five?

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.210
Well, remember that this is not a mathematical statement.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.560
It's a computer programming statement,

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.094
more like an instruction or command.

00:00:49.094 --> 00:00:51.869
We're basically telling the computer to change

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:56.064
the value of passengers to become the old value plus five.

00:00:56.064 --> 00:00:58.349
The way computers translate its statements like

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.210
this is by starting from the right hand side of the equal sign.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.359
The computer calculates whatever this right hand side is,

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:07.579
which is the old value plus five,

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:11.385
and then sets it into the left hand side of the equal sign.

00:01:11.385 --> 00:01:13.640
That's why you should only have

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.594
one variable on the left hand side of the equal sign here.

00:01:17.594 --> 00:01:21.359
Remember, we're not giving the computer a math puzzle to solve.

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:24.275
We're giving them clear and precise instructions,

00:01:24.275 --> 00:01:28.890
that is, update passengers to become all passengers plus five.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.504
Now, I assume the bus continues to go

00:01:31.504 --> 00:01:35.349
and is supposed to drop off three passengers in the next stop.

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:39.954
So, we basically want to subtract three from our variable passengers here.

00:01:39.954 --> 00:01:42.034
It's exactly the same as adding to it.

00:01:42.034 --> 00:01:44.765
We just type in the variable name equals

00:01:44.765 --> 00:01:48.855
the variable name again minus whatever value we want to subtract.

00:01:48.855 --> 00:01:51.170
So, this would update the variable passengers,

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.030
setting it to whatever old value it was minus three.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.920
Brilliant. So now our passengers is updated and our bus keeps moving on.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.460
Say at this stop one passenger leaves the bus and five more hop on.

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:10.459
What would you write here to update our passengers variable to subtract one and add five?
