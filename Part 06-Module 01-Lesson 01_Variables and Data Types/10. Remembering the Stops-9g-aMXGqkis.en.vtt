00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.914
Computers can actually keep track of more than one variable at a time,

00:00:03.914 --> 00:00:06.929
something that us humans struggle with,

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:11.309
which means that we could have a variable keeping track of the number of stops a bus

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.660
makes and another variable that keeps track of the ticket fare collected on the bus.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.269
Have a look at this Java program over here.

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:23.535
What do you think this print line statement at the end will print on the screen?

00:00:23.535 --> 00:00:26.250
Will it display the word stops,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.795
or the number one,

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:30.735
or the number three, or the number seven?

00:00:30.734 --> 00:00:32.280
There's only one correct answer here.
