00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.221
The print line command is not only used to display text.

00:00:04.221 --> 00:00:07.970
You can also print out the result of a calculation, for example.

00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:13.559
Like this statement here, System.out.Println(2+3);

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.630
Notice that I didn't put any quotation marks

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.153
around this here because we don't want to display it as text.

00:00:18.152 --> 00:00:21.759
We actually want the result of this mathematical calculation.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.740
So, when we run this Java program here with those two statements,

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.144
the output we get is, Hello world!

00:00:29.144 --> 00:00:31.890
just exactly as we typed it in here.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.954
But then the second line is just 5,

00:00:34.954 --> 00:00:37.369
which is the result of 2+3.

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:39.829
Notice how each one was printed in a separate line,

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.974
hence print line command and how the first one was displayed exactly as we typed it in,

00:00:44.975 --> 00:00:48.070
while the second one was the result of the calculation.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.884
Computers can do a lot more than just display a message on the screen.

00:00:51.884 --> 00:00:53.960
Yep. They can make decisions and perform

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.920
calculations based on the information that we give them.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.015
In fact, let me show you what a computer can do that us humans are terrible at.

00:01:01.015 --> 00:01:02.299
Suzanne, do you want to play a game?

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:03.439
Sure. What game?

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:04.819
It's a memory game.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.424
You might need to use these.

00:01:07.424 --> 00:01:11.629
So imagine that there's this bus that starts off with no passengers on board

00:01:11.629 --> 00:01:16.204
and then later on three passengers hop on and two passengers hop off.

00:01:16.204 --> 00:01:20.129
Later on one more passenger hops on and no one hops off.

00:01:20.129 --> 00:01:25.339
Later on another passenger hops on and another passenger hops off.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.380
My question is how many stops did the bus make?

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:30.609
Oh, no, I wasn't keeping track of that.

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:34.340
I know. But you did a really good job keeping track of the passengers on the bus.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.340
It's also interesting that you only needed one box to do that.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.770
Yeah. That's because all I needed to keep track

00:01:39.769 --> 00:01:42.810
of is just this one single number of passengers onboard.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.460
I didn't really need to remember every single number you said.

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:50.000
True and that's exactly what a computer would have done as well. Let me show you how.
