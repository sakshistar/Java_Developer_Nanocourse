&gt;&gt; Hey Suzanne, do you want to play this mind game thing again?

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.041
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:07.919
Yes.

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.259
&gt;&gt; Haim is the bus driver who woke up this morning with a new journey in mind.

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.504
The first stop, there were three passengers who hopped on the bus and

00:00:16.504 --> 00:00:21.494
the second stop there were two passengers who hopped on and one passenger hopped off.

00:00:21.495 --> 00:00:22.605
And then the third stop,

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:27.230
there were two passengers who hopped on, and two passengers off.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.030
And then the last stop there were three passengers who

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.399
hopped on and no passengers hopped off.

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:39.640
My question is, what's the bus driver's name?

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.600
Okay, let's see how a computer would have

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.539
remembered both the bus driver's name and all these numbers at the same time.
