00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.900
Hey.

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.580
Welcome.

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.000
We're really excited that you chose to learn Java.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.365
Yeah, Java is one of the most popular programming languages out there.

00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:09.660
Yup. And together we're going to learn how to use it to

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.289
program a computer to do whatever you want it to do.

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:12.929
That's true.

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.939
In this lesson you will program the computer to

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:17.765
remember numbers and texts using variables.

00:00:17.765 --> 00:00:21.300
You'll get to use those variables to do calculations that even us humans can't do.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.519
In lesson two you'll get to teach

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.864
the computer how to make decisions when faced with multiple choices.

00:00:26.864 --> 00:00:29.250
And in lesson three you'll get to write your own sets of

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.600
instructions for computers to follow using functions.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.520
Yup. And in lesson four you will get to write programs that can repeat

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.490
instructions over and over again for billions of times if needed.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.286
By lesson five you should be ready to work on your first big project.

00:00:42.286 --> 00:00:44.699
You'll need to install some tools to get you started,

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.960
but don't worry, we'll walk you through that step by step when we get to them.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.000
All right. Let's get started.
