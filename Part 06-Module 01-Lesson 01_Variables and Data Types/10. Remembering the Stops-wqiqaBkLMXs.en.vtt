00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.274
So the correct answer here is three.

00:00:03.274 --> 00:00:07.109
This is because it's printing out the value of the variable stops.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.380
Why did this not print out the word stops?

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.470
Because we're not surrounding it by quotation marks down here.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.679
Instead because it doesn't have quotation marks,

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:18.989
Java assumes that this is a variable and prints

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.869
out the value of that variable at that time.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.050
But why three? Why not one and seven?

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.410
Well, let's trace this program and see.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.429
First thing that happens here is declaring those two variables here, stops and fare.

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:37.039
Both are of type integers because they will only store natural numbers.

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:41.359
Let me draw this table on the side here so I can keep track of the variables

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:45.945
stops and fare side by side as I go through the program.

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:47.960
Once a variable changes,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.024
I strike it out and write the new value underneath.

00:00:51.024 --> 00:00:54.696
As you can see here both variables are initialized to zero,

00:00:54.697 --> 00:00:58.890
which means that stop has zero and fare has zero.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.049
Then this line here adds one to our variable stops and updates

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.816
our variable stops that way so stops instead of becoming zero would become one.

00:01:09.816 --> 00:01:14.109
The next line here says fare equals fare plus five,

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:18.140
which is adding five to our variable fare and updating it.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.090
So instead of fare being zero it would become five.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.609
The next line here is updating our variable stops by adding one to it.

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:28.420
So instead of it being one,

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.359
it becomes two, and our variable fare becomes fare plus three.

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.079
So instead of it being five,

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:40.593
it becomes eight and then our stops the variable gets updated again by adding one to it,

00:01:40.593 --> 00:01:42.890
so instead of two, it becomes three.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.329
And finally our fare variable gets updated by adding seven to it.

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.385
So adding seven to eight makes it 15.

00:01:50.385 --> 00:01:54.799
So by the time we get to this print line statement at the end here,

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:01.334
it seems like the current values of stops is three and the current value of fare is 15.

00:02:01.334 --> 00:02:06.719
But this is only printing out the variable stops which happen to be three.

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.000
So the print output of this program is three.
