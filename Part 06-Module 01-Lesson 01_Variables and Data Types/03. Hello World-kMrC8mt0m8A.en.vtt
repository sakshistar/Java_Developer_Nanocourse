00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.100
Computers are really good at following instructions,

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.205
but those instructions have to be precise and detailed.

00:00:07.205 --> 00:00:11.679
For example, if you ask the computer to sort your files without giving much detail,

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.864
it won't know which files you want to sort or whether you want to sort them by name,

00:00:15.865 --> 00:00:17.980
or date, or size.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.859
There's a lot of unanswered questions in this command here.

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.189
A more precise list of instructions would be to tell the computer

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.615
step-by-step exactly what to do: open this particular folder,

00:00:29.615 --> 00:00:30.984
go through all the files in it,

00:00:30.984 --> 00:00:32.484
find the most recent one,

00:00:32.484 --> 00:00:33.784
and then place it at the top,

00:00:33.784 --> 00:00:36.644
and repeat that for the remaining files.

00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:41.165
This list of instructions here answers all possible questions that a computer may have.

00:00:41.164 --> 00:00:43.994
And so, it would happily follow them without any problems.

00:00:43.994 --> 00:00:47.169
So, those list of instructions here should be told to

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.564
the computer in the language it understands, like Java.

00:00:51.564 --> 00:00:54.859
Java Language is a computer language that uses

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:59.590
basic English words but in a very specific way that computers can understand.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.460
It offers a huge library of

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.454
instructions and commands that you could just use straight away,

00:01:04.454 --> 00:01:09.114
like this one for example which you'd probably use a lot in this course.

00:01:09.114 --> 00:01:11.409
This command here instructs the computer to

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.064
display something on the screen like a text message,

00:01:14.064 --> 00:01:16.120
or the result of a calculation,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.145
or a decision that the computer just made.

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:22.828
It's written as follows: system dot out dot print line,

00:01:22.828 --> 00:01:26.169
shortened to 'println,' followed by those set of parentheses here,

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.620
and then terminated with this semi-colon at the end.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.390
This is a computer system command that displays

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.415
some text as an output by printing it to the screen as a new line.

00:01:38.415 --> 00:01:40.450
But what does it print exactly?

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.534
Anything you write within those set of parentheses here.

00:01:43.534 --> 00:01:46.950
So say we want to printout this message, "Hello, World!"

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.019
then that's what we write in there.

00:01:49.019 --> 00:01:51.373
So once you run this command, the message "Hello, World!"

00:01:51.373 --> 00:01:53.454
will be displayed.

00:01:53.454 --> 00:01:55.495
Sounds simple enough.

00:01:55.495 --> 00:01:57.510
However there's a few things that we need to take

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.525
extra care when we're writing Java programs.

00:02:00.525 --> 00:02:02.430
Let's have a look at a few.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.940
First of all, it's important to know that Java is case sensitive,

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.550
which means that capital letters and small letters matter.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.860
So if we try to write this command like this, system.out,println();

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.616
just exactly the same but with a small s,

00:02:16.616 --> 00:02:18.630
then Java won't really understand what

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.599
we're saying and it won't be able to run that command.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.155
Also note that I've used those quotation marks here.

00:02:25.155 --> 00:02:27.855
That's because we want to display this message "Hello, World!"

00:02:27.855 --> 00:02:30.090
exactly as we typed it in.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.284
We will see other options later on.

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:35.375
Finally, this little semi-colon at the end here,

00:02:35.375 --> 00:02:38.520
tells the computer that this is the end of this instruction.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.060
Anything else I type after that is the beginning of a new instruction.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.740
This is really handy when we get to

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.395
more complicated instructions that can be written in multiple lines.

00:02:47.395 --> 00:02:50.175
Now, why don't you go ahead and try this yourself.

00:02:50.175 --> 00:02:55.060
After this video, you can edit this statement here and run your own program.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.064
Try to change this message here to display "Java Rocks!"

00:02:58.064 --> 00:03:00.000
instead of "Hello, World!"
