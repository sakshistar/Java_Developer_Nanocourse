00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
So the correct solution was the first statement here,

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.370
passengers equals passengers minus one plus five.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.025
As you've probably noticed by now,

00:00:08.025 --> 00:00:12.550
we can actually perform more than one arithmetic operation in the same statement.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.420
Of course we could have written them down into two statements like we did

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:19.969
before or we could have even started by adding five and then subtracting one.

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:22.649
However, none of these ones are correct. Let's see why.

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:27.054
This one here is saying passengers equals five minus one.

00:00:27.054 --> 00:00:29.699
So it is five and subtracting one,

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.759
but it's not updating upon the previous value of passengers like the one here.

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:37.724
So this will set our passengers variable to four

00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:42.060
regardless of whatever happened before. That's not correct.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.270
This one here is updating our variable passengers but it's

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.145
subtracting five and adding one which is the opposite of what we want to do.

00:00:49.145 --> 00:00:52.260
And the last option here seems like it's doing the right thing as

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:55.704
well but it's still not updating passengers up here.

00:00:55.704 --> 00:00:59.869
It's just setting it to five and then subtracting one from it.

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:02.309
That leaves us with this only correct option,

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.600
passengers equals passengers minus one plus five.
