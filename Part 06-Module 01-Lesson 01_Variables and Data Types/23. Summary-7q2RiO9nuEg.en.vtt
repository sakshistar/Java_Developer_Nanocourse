00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.990
Guess what? That's it for this lesson.

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.370
We hope you had fun and learned a lot about variables.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.240
Yes, we've seen how variables work just like the boxes in real life.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.914
And how computers use them to keep track of numbers using

00:00:11.914 --> 00:00:16.500
integers or doubles or floats and how it remembers text using strings.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.879
Don't forget all the operations we've learned like adding and multiplying

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:24.589
numbers and how we could use that plus sign to stitch strings together which was called

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:27.179
string concatenation.

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.030
Suzanne will teach you about how computers can make decisions in the next lesson.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.490
But before that, don't forget to check out your first project assignment.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.000
Good luck and see you in the next lesson.
