00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.570
So far, we've programmed the computer to keep track of the number of passengers.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:09.574
Now, say we want the computer to show us how many passengers are on the bus so far.

00:00:09.574 --> 00:00:13.890
We know its stored inside this variable called passengers here.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.024
But how do we tell the computer to show us its value?

00:00:17.024 --> 00:00:20.649
Remember that print line instruction that we learned earlier?

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:23.219
That's exactly what we need now.

00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:27.779
However this time, we want it to show us the value inside that variable.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.750
To do that, we should type in the word passengers but without quotation marks.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.090
Remember that quotation marks are used when we want

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.050
to display a message or the word as it is.

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:43.369
But here, we don't want it to display the word passengers itself.

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:47.750
Instead, we want to see the value stored inside that variable.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.359
So, when we type in something inside those parentheses here without the quotation marks,

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:57.590
Java automatically assumes that this is a variable and starts looking for

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.060
the value stored inside

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.780
that variable and displays it because this is a print line statement.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.224
Which means, if we run this program here,

00:01:05.224 --> 00:01:06.739
we get this print output,

00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:11.579
six, which happens to be the value of our variable passengers here.

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:14.649
Let's trace this program step by step and

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.105
see why the variable passengers ended up with six inside.

00:01:18.105 --> 00:01:21.880
This statement here is declaring this variable passengers of

00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:24.159
type integer which is basically creating

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.744
this empty box that we can store integer variables in it.

00:01:27.745 --> 00:01:30.040
The second statement is initializing it to

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.570
zero which is basically adding the number zero inside.

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:35.799
Then, the next statement is updating

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.369
the variable passengers by adding five to its old value.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.625
Its old value happen to be zero,

00:01:41.625 --> 00:01:45.769
so when we add five to zero and update it, it becomes five.

00:01:45.769 --> 00:01:49.840
And then the following statement here is subtracting three from

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.555
the old value which is five and updating passengers to this result of the subtraction.

00:01:55.555 --> 00:01:58.285
So we subtract three from five making it two,

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:00.804
and passengers becomes two.

00:02:00.805 --> 00:02:04.120
And then finally, this statement here is subtracting one

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.650
and adding five to the old value of passengers which is two, now.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.795
So when we subtract one, it becomes one,

00:02:09.794 --> 00:02:12.984
and then we add five, passengers becomes six.

00:02:12.985 --> 00:02:15.960
By the time we reach this final statement here,

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.885
our variable passengers will have six in it,

00:02:18.884 --> 00:02:20.469
and when we print it out,

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:22.000
this is the output that we get.
