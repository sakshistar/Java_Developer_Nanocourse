00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.935
Congratulations! You've made it this far already.

00:00:02.935 --> 00:00:07.175
We've learned so much about variables and sorts of operations you can perform on them.

00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:10.913
We've seen how to concatenate strings together and we've seen how to add,

00:00:10.913 --> 00:00:14.789
multiply, subtract and divide integers and doubles as well.

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:17.024
Now let's have a look at this program here.

00:00:17.024 --> 00:00:20.399
What do you think it would print as an output when you run it?

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:21.779
Notice how the variables x,

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.745
y and z keep changing over time and then we finally print those three values.

00:00:26.745 --> 00:00:29.380
Which one of those would be the correct output?

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:32.129
Remember to follow this program step by step and

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.000
keep track of the value of each variable individually.
