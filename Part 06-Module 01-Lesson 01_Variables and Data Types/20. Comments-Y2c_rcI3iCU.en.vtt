Writing code in Java language is mainly for computers to understand,

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.394
but it's also supposed to make sense for us programmers too.

00:00:07.394 --> 00:00:10.199
You'll most likely be working in a team of programmers

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:13.929
reading other people's code while others reading your code.

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.259
So it's really important to make sure that

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.820
your code and variable names are self-descriptive.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.320
But when your program gets longer and longer,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.589
things start to get confusing and you would need a lot

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:29.074
more than just Java statements to explain what your program is doing.

00:00:29.074 --> 00:00:31.410
This is why Java allows you to add notes

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.350
or comments in between your lines of code like that.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.405
These lines of code would be entirely ignored by the computer running your program.

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:42.215
But for anyone else reading your code it would explain a lot.

00:00:42.215 --> 00:00:43.770
To add a comment in your code,

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.345
simply start the line with those two forward slashes over here.

00:00:47.344 --> 00:00:50.009
Then feel free to write whatever you want after that,

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:53.939
usually things that would explain the instruction that happens right after that.

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:55.784
And when you actually run the program,

00:00:55.784 --> 00:00:58.259
computer will just ignore any line that starts with

00:00:58.259 --> 00:01:02.219
those two forward slashes and run the actual lines of code in between.

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.890
These lines of nodes are called comments.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.980
It's a really good idea to add as many comments as you need

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.575
that would make your code a lot more understandable when someone else reads it.

00:01:11.575 --> 00:01:13.515
If you want to be even more descriptive,

00:01:13.515 --> 00:01:16.109
you can write a multi-line comment by starting

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:19.109
the first line with this forward slash followed by the asterisk,

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:22.094
and ending it with the asterisk and then the forward slash.

00:01:22.094 --> 00:01:25.814
You can write anything in between those two marks in multiple lines,

00:01:25.814 --> 00:01:27.314
which means you don't have to start

00:01:27.314 --> 00:01:30.444
every line with those two forward slashes like before.

00:01:30.444 --> 00:01:34.449
A well commented code is much easier to understand and follow.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.620
Make a habit of commenting anything that might not be clear from the code itself.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.240
And trust me, even reading your own code that you haven't seen in

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:46.750
a while won't make any sense without those precious comments that explain.
