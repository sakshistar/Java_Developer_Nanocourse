00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.094
So, the correct answer is this last option here,

00:00:04.094 --> 00:00:10.169
I love JAVA, where love is all lower case letters and JAVA is all uppercase letters.

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:12.634
Why is that the correct output there?

00:00:12.634 --> 00:00:14.750
Because we're printing out I,

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.609
which is a string literal here,

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.140
so it gets printed out exactly the same and

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.109
then we concatenate that with a variable feeling,

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.169
which happens to be this love string that was updated to all lower cases.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.450
That will print out love with

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.289
a lowercase l and then we're

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:37.155
concatenating that with an empty string which is just a space.

00:00:37.155 --> 00:00:43.814
And then finally, with the variable language which started with a string literal Java,

00:00:43.814 --> 00:00:46.004
and then we updated it to become

00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:50.565
all uppercase letters so that's going to be JAVA in all uppercase letters.

00:00:50.564 --> 00:00:57.000
The output would be I space love space JAVA, like that.
