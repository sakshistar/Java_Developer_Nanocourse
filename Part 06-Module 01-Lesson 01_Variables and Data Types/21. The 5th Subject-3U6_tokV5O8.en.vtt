00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.260
From the comment here,

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.030
we can tell that this fifth subject was

00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:06.324
music and that your friend scored 96 percent in it.

00:00:06.325 --> 00:00:11.664
So, the first thing we need to do is declare this music variable and initialize it to 96.

00:00:11.664 --> 00:00:14.599
Then we need to include it in our sum variable here,

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.140
so we just add music to the rest of the subjects.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.679
But now because we are dividing by five subjects

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.660
instead of four we just need to change that four into five.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.219
And that's pretty much it.

00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:26.549
Our new average would now calculate everything

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.519
including our new music subject and if we run

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.995
this program it would print the output of

00:00:31.995 --> 00:00:36.120
90.0 which is the average value of all five subjects.
