00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.759
It seems like those two statements are the ones that have problems in them.

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:06.472
Let's go through them one by one and see why.

00:00:06.472 --> 00:00:08.910
The first one is a variable called me of

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.219
type char and it's initialized this character uppercase I.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.050
There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with this.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.330
It's declared as a character and it's being initialized to this character.

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:24.869
Perfect. The second one is a variable called fact that is

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.609
declared of type Boolean and it's initialized this value true.

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.519
That also seems to be perfectly fine.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.040
This one however, is the variable number which is declared to be of type Boolean,

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:41.100
but it's initialized to this number 17.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.463
As we mentioned earlier,

00:00:42.463 --> 00:00:46.769
Boolean variables can only store a value of true or false.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.735
They cannot store numbers.

00:00:48.734 --> 00:00:51.104
So this one is incorrect.

00:00:51.104 --> 00:00:53.729
This one is a string called text that is

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:57.119
initialized to this text within double quotation marks.

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:59.219
So that's perfectly fine.

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.214
This one's the variable price of type

00:01:01.215 --> 00:01:05.775
double and it's initialized to this fractional number 23.75,

00:01:05.775 --> 00:01:10.530
because it's a double it's allowed to store fractional numbers so that's perfectly fine.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.120
This last one however,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.954
is the variable total of type long,

00:01:14.954 --> 00:01:17.834
but it's initialized to this 100.1.

00:01:17.834 --> 00:01:19.739
Long are like integers,

00:01:19.739 --> 00:01:21.352
they only store natural numbers,

00:01:21.352 --> 00:01:23.799
you're not allowed to have a fractional number in them.

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:26.000
So Java would complain about this one as well.
