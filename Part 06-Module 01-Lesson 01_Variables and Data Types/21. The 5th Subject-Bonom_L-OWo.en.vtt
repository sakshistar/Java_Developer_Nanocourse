00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.690
Now imagine a friend of yours just finished high school and

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.755
asked you to write a Java program to help him calculate the total average grade.

00:00:07.754 --> 00:00:10.140
The average grade is simply the total sum of

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.769
grades divided by the number of subjects graded.

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.295
However, your friend only knows four of his five subjects' grade so far.

00:00:17.295 --> 00:00:20.145
So for now the average can be calculated by adding

00:00:20.144 --> 00:00:23.850
all those grades for those four subjects divided by four.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.840
Once you write the program that would calculate the average for those four subjects,

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.920
it should be really easy to add this fifth subject into the average calculation.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.670
Let's start by declaring and initializing a variable for each subject.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.535
Notice that some grades are fractions.

00:00:37.534 --> 00:00:40.584
So to stay consistent Let's declare them all as doubles.

00:00:40.585 --> 00:00:45.265
Now, we need to calculate the sum of all these grades and store that in a variable.

00:00:45.265 --> 00:00:47.250
These variables should also be a double.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.314
Let's call it 'sum' and set it to equal to the sum of all those four grades.

00:00:52.314 --> 00:00:54.449
Then finally to calculate the average,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.820
we simply need to divide this sum by four and store the result into the variable average.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.619
Now let's try to print this variable average and see what the result is.

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:08.170
The output of such program would be 88.5. That sounds about right.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.689
Now, say your friend has finally got his grade for the missing fifth subject.

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.719
I've written down all the details in a comment in the code next.

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:20.534
Try to modify this program to calculate the new average of all five subjects.

00:01:20.534 --> 00:01:22.829
Remember to start by declaring a new variable for

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:26.000
that fifth subject and then add it to the average calculation.
