00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.745
If we wanted to update the variable passengers,

00:00:02.745 --> 00:00:06.195
to subtract one and add five given our code here,

00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:07.455
what should come next?

00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:11.144
Which one of those statements should follow those statements here,

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:14.265
so we can update our passengers variable correctly?

00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:16.000
There is only one correct answer.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.440
Should it be passengers equal passengers minus one plus five?

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.615
Or passengers equals five minus one?

00:00:22.614 --> 00:00:26.320
Or should it be passenger equals passengers minus five plus one?

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.460
Or should it be both those statements here,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.000
passengers equals five, and then passengers equal passengers minus one?
