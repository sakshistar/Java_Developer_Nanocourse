00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.094
Computers use something like the box Suzanne used, they're called variables.

00:00:05.094 --> 00:00:09.099
Each variable in Java has a name and a value.

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.785
The name doesn't change but the value can keep changing,

00:00:12.785 --> 00:00:16.609
just like the balls that Suzanne used in the box.

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.714
Those values don't always have to be numbers.

00:00:19.714 --> 00:00:22.445
They can be letters or even text.

00:00:22.445 --> 00:00:25.879
However, once you create a variable of a certain type,

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:30.594
you can only use it to store values of that particular type.

00:00:30.594 --> 00:00:33.240
For example, if we wanted to create a variable

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.135
that keeps track of the number of passengers on the bus,

00:00:36.134 --> 00:00:38.879
the type of values here are natural numbers,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.865
like zero, three, seven and so on.

00:00:41.865 --> 00:00:45.450
Because we can't really have a fraction of a person on the bus, right?

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.540
I'd hope so. Natural numbers in Java are called integers.

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.570
If we wanted to create a variable of type integer in Java,

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.285
we will write down int,

00:00:56.284 --> 00:00:59.399
which is short for integer and then the variable name,

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.714
which is something that we can come up with, say, passengers.

00:01:02.715 --> 00:01:04.079
And then, as usual,

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:06.629
we end the statement here with a semi-colon,

00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:09.214
just like we did with a print line earlier.

00:01:09.215 --> 00:01:12.930
This statement here, tells the computer to create

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.800
this empty box that can store natural numbers inside and its name is passengers.

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.060
What we just did here is called declaring a variable.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.644
This variable now can be used to store any integer number,

00:01:26.644 --> 00:01:30.619
which can easily change as more people go on or off the bus.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.240
Let's start using it.

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:35.054
The first thing we need to do is set it to zero.

00:01:35.055 --> 00:01:37.940
We do that by typing in the variable name followed by

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:43.129
this equals sign and then the value we want to set it to in this case zero.

00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:46.789
And then, never forget that semi-colon at the end.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.870
This is basically as if we've inserted the number zero in our box.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.540
What we just did here is called initializing our

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.010
variable or giving it an initial value basically.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.375
There you go.

00:01:59.375 --> 00:02:02.825
Now our passengers variable has the value zero in it.

00:02:02.825 --> 00:02:05.900
Which means our bus has zero passengers.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.210
Let's start updating it.
