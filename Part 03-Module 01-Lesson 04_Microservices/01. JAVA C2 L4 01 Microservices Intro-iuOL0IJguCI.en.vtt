Hello, I'm Kisha Williams.

00:00:02.084 --> 00:00:03.419
Welcome to my course,

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.669
web services and APIs.

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:10.650
Today, I'm going to teach you about developing microservices using spring boot.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.054
When developing microservices, there are several steps.

00:00:14.054 --> 00:00:18.179
First, I will show you how to create a registry service that will allow

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:22.995
your services to be registered and found by clients that need to call them.

00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:28.770
Next, I will teach you how to create a REST API using spring data REST,

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.015
which generates REST APIs from a spring data repository.

00:00:33.015 --> 00:00:36.570
Next, we wrap up with testing the microservice.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.799
So let's get started.
