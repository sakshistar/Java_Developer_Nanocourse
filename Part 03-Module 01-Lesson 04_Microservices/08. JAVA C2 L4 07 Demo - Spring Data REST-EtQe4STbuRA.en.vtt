00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:05.429
Let's see this in action.

00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:09.029
Let's look at the items Microservices module.

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:11.489
First, let's look at the Maven POM file.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.800
Our dependencies we have the spring-boot-starter-jpa to include jpa.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.804
We have the spring-boot-starter-web which we've seen before.

00:00:20.804 --> 00:00:27.405
The starter-test, and for h2 or in-memory database the h2 dependency.

00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:34.010
The new dependency that we've added for spring data rest can be found here on lines 42.

00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:38.629
43. It is the spring-boot-starter-data-rest.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.015
Let's look at the entity item.

00:00:41.015 --> 00:00:44.509
Here item is an entity that has an ID,

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:46.384
a name, and a description.

00:00:46.384 --> 00:00:48.619
The item entity also has

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:54.359
the associated item repository for interacting with the h2 in memory database.

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.159
Then the application.propertiesfile, what we've seen

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.629
before setting the path to h2 and the data source URL,

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.945
here in this case two items.

00:01:04.944 --> 00:01:09.875
That's all you need to expose the item table through a spring data rest API.

00:01:09.875 --> 00:01:11.885
There's no controller layer,

00:01:11.885 --> 00:01:15.770
no need to use address controller that annotation anywhere.

00:01:15.769 --> 00:01:22.619
Now, I've deployed and executed the application and to access the items microservice,

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:30.320
let's navigate to a web browser and just enter localhost:8080 and items.

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:32.814
So that's item with an s on the end.

00:01:32.814 --> 00:01:38.164
Notice here it shows a listing of all of the items in our database table.

00:01:38.165 --> 00:01:40.835
Now that we've created this microservice,

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:44.399
let's register it as a eureka client.
