00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.275
Today, you learned about developing Microservices using Spring Boot.

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:07.800
When developing Microservices, there are several steps.

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.655
First, I showed you how to create a Registry Service using Netflix Eureka,

00:00:12.654 --> 00:00:18.015
that allows your services to be registered and found by clients that need to call them.

00:00:18.015 --> 00:00:23.460
Next, I taught you how to create a simple Rest API using Spring Data Rest,

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.464
which generated Rest APIs' from a Spring Data Repository.

00:00:27.464 --> 00:00:31.304
We wrapped up with me showing you how to call a Microservice.

00:00:31.304 --> 00:00:37.600
Next, I will teach you about securing API endpoints using Spring Security.
