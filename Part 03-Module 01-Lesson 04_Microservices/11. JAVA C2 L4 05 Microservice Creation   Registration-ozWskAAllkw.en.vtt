00:00:03.229 --> 00:00:05.519
In this case study,

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:09.164
I have a simple item listing microservice.

00:00:09.164 --> 00:00:12.914
This microservice uses Spring data to implement

00:00:12.914 --> 00:00:15.419
a JPA item repository and

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:20.115
Spring Data REST to provide a restful interface to item information.

00:00:20.114 --> 00:00:24.494
In most respects, this is a straightforward Spring Boot application.

00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:27.464
However, this application is special because it

00:00:27.464 --> 00:00:31.019
registers itself with a discovery server at startup.

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.594
The first step is to create a microservice using Spring Data REST.

00:00:35.594 --> 00:00:39.159
So let's learn more about Spring Data REST.
