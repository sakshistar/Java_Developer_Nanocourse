00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
Today, we learned how to build a RESTful APIs using Spring Boot.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.904
First, you learned about the REST architecture style.

00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:11.280
Next, we bootstrapped a very simple application

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:14.279
using the web version of Spring Initializr.

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:20.160
Then, we added a REST controller that received and responded to client request.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.035
You learned about useful annotations like @RestController and @GetMapping.

00:00:26.035 --> 00:00:28.559
We wrapped up with exception handling.

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:34.960
Next, I will teach you about developing GraphQL APIs using Spring Boot.
