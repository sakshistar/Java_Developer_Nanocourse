00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.234
REST, stands for Representational State Transfer.

00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:06.689
It's a set of guidelines,

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.335
application developers use to design APIs.

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:13.500
There are four principles that APIs follow.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.509
First, data and functionality in the API are considered resources and

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.595
identified through something called the URI or Uniform Resource Identifier.

00:00:23.594 --> 00:00:26.309
These are often accessed by web links.

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:31.994
Second, resources are manipulated using a fixed set of operations.

00:00:31.995 --> 00:00:35.730
GET retrieves a resource, POST creates one,

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:37.918
use PUT to update the resource,

00:00:37.918 --> 00:00:40.544
and of course DELETE will remove it.

00:00:40.545 --> 00:00:46.010
Third, resources can be represented in multiple formats like HTML,

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:50.844
XML plain texts, and other formats defined by immediate type.

00:00:50.844 --> 00:00:55.729
Finally, communication between the client and endpoint is stateless.

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:58.069
Meaning, the server will not remember or

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.204
store any state about the client that made the call.

00:01:01.204 --> 00:01:07.534
Restful APIs are easier to create and easier for many clients to consume.

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:12.185
They are used a lot for web integration and mobile device applications.

00:01:12.185 --> 00:01:17.180
So let's look at how we build rest APIs using Spring Boot.
