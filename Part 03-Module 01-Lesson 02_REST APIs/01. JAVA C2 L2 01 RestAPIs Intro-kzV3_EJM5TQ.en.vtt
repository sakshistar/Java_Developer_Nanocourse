Hello, I'm Kesha Williams.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.525
Welcome to my course,

00:00:03.524 --> 00:00:05.594
Web Services and APIs.

00:00:05.594 --> 00:00:10.515
Today, I'm going to teach you about how to build RESTful APIs using Spring Boot.

00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:13.875
First, I will teach you about the REST architecture style,

00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:19.140
then I will show you how to bootstrap a simple application using the spring initializer,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.359
then we will add a rest controller to

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.530
the application to handle incoming client requests for data.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.380
I will teach you about the annotations required,

00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:32.070
how to properly format the response back to the calling client,

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.409
and we will wrap up with exception handling.

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:36.759
So let's get started.
