The additional files I've added relate to

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:07.439
the additional layers needed for the RESTful API.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.995
So for example, you have this entity layer,

00:00:10.994 --> 00:00:13.244
there's the repository layer,

00:00:13.244 --> 00:00:15.614
the service layer and the web layer.

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:22.365
So all of the typical layers in the stack of a RESTful API.

00:00:22.364 --> 00:00:27.224
First, lets look at the entity called location.

00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:29.790
So open up the location file.

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.549
If you're not familiar with entities,

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:37.319
entities are simply objects that limit the database and they have the ability to

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.149
be mapped from the database table to a Java object.

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.670
Entities are defined by this at entity annotation here,

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.039
and the location entity is very simple,

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.994
it has an id which is a unique identifier,

00:00:51.994 --> 00:00:54.924
it has a name and it has an address.

00:00:54.924 --> 00:00:58.739
Now let's look at the location controller.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.865
So this is the C in the MVC architecture.

00:01:02.865 --> 00:01:08.450
The controller will receive and respond to client requests for data.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:15.305
This controller is identified here on line 13 by this at rest controller annotation.

00:01:15.305 --> 00:01:20.110
There's also a location service which I'll talk about more in a moment.

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:23.390
I'm auto wiring a location service being so that I can

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.049
use it here in my get all locations method.

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.004
Notice here on line 22,

00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:36.109
I'm using the at get mapping annotation and I'm passing in a location path.

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:39.185
This annotation is important because it maps

00:01:39.185 --> 00:01:43.579
HTTP get requests to the correct handler method.

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.450
So anytime a get request comes in,

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.734
but the path of location its going to route it to this method called get all locations.

00:01:52.734 --> 00:01:54.659
This is a very simple method.

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.200
Here on line 24,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.350
I'm using the location service to retrieve a list of locations.

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:05.069
Next, let's navigate to the location service.
