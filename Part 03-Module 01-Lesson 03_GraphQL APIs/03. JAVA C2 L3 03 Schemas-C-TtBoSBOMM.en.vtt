00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.195
There is a concept that you should be aware of

00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:09.195
when dealing with GraphQL. It's the schema.

00:00:09.195 --> 00:00:14.669
The GraphQL Schema defines the data points offered via an API.

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:17.730
The schema contains the data types and

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.185
relationships between them and a set of operations available.

00:00:22.184 --> 00:00:27.390
Things like queries where retrieving data and mutations for creating,

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.580
updating, and deleting data.

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.829
This is a sample schema.

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.239
Notice, we identify the type which is location,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.615
we enter the different attributes for the location,

00:00:39.615 --> 00:00:42.240
ID, name, and address.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.425
Notice, in this middle section,

00:00:44.424 --> 00:00:46.204
we're adding the queries.

00:00:46.204 --> 00:00:49.339
So one query find all locations.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.130
In the last section,

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.270
we're adding the mutations.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.690
So we create a new location or we delete

00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:01.199
an existing location or we update a location name.
