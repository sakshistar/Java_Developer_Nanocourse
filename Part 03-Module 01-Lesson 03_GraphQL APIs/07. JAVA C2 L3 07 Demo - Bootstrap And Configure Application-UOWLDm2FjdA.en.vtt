00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
Let's see the steps to develop a graphQL API using Spring Boot.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.660
At this point, you can clone the code from

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.615
the link in the course notes and follow along with me.

00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:14.294
First, we're going to bootstrap a simple application using the spring initializr.

00:00:14.294 --> 00:00:16.079
We've seen this tool before.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.854
For project maven language Java,

00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:20.565
leave the default here.

00:00:20.565 --> 00:00:22.993
For the project metadata,

00:00:22.993 --> 00:00:27.509
let's change this to something more descriptive, here as well.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.890
Just like before, we're going to add the web dependency,

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.645
the H2 dependency, and the JPA dependency.

00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:42.515
Now, you would think that you could go ahead and add the graphQL dependency,

00:00:42.515 --> 00:00:44.840
but we have to add those manually.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.820
Generate the project, you'll download the zip,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.384
you can unzip it and open it in your IDE.

00:00:52.384 --> 00:00:54.259
So let's navigate to that.

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:58.129
Bringing up intelligence to the palm file.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.798
Scroll down, as expected,

00:01:00.798 --> 00:01:03.549
we see JPA here on line 24,

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:06.224
H2 here on line 29,

00:01:06.224 --> 00:01:08.424
the Spring Bootstarter tests,

00:01:08.424 --> 00:01:11.795
and Spring Boot Starter web here on line 40.

00:01:11.795 --> 00:01:16.040
So the first two dependencies that you have to add in your palm file are

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.925
shown here on lines 43 through 53.

00:01:20.924 --> 00:01:24.239
So this is the graphQL Spring Boot Starter,

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:26.905
and the graphQL Java tools.

00:01:26.905 --> 00:01:31.655
There is one more dependency that you'll need to add for graphQL,

00:01:31.655 --> 00:01:35.700
and that's shown here on lines 55 through 59.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.740
Just like in our previous project,

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:41.289
there's the data.SQL file that simply adds

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.500
sample data to our location table in our H2 database.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.750
So we're adding five airport locations.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.590
On the application properties file, just like before,

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.240
we can figure H2,

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:55.319
we set the path,

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:57.434
and we set the database URL.

00:01:57.435 --> 00:02:01.125
Now, notice here lines five through seven,

00:02:01.125 --> 00:02:03.659
this is where we can figure graphQL,

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.435
specifically the mapping for the servlet,

00:02:06.435 --> 00:02:10.574
and we're enabling the servlet and we're enabling forms.

00:02:10.574 --> 00:02:12.629
Lines nine through 11,

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.310
these are the configuration items for graphiQL.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.175
So here again, I'm enabling it,

00:02:19.175 --> 00:02:22.385
setting the endpoint, and setting the mapping.

00:02:22.384 --> 00:02:25.829
Next, let's look at schema creation.
