00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:10.454
Let's see the steps to create a GraphQL API using Spring Boot.

00:00:10.455 --> 00:00:14.550
First, I will show you how to bootstrap a simple application,

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.750
then I will show you where to place the GraphQL dependencies.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.559
We will use the same case study from the previous lesson

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:26.759
to return a list of locations persistent in H2.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.710
Next, I will show you how to create the schema and the API.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.740
Then I will show you how to use GraphiQL to issue queries and mutations against the data.
