00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
Today, you learned about GraphQL,

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.800
a query language for APIs.

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.634
We discussed the GraphQL schema which defines the datapoints offered via an API.

00:00:10.634 --> 00:00:15.300
Don't forget the schema contains the datatypes and relationships between them,

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.685
and the set of operations available.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:22.890
Next, we saw the importance of using Resolvers for queries and Mutators.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.670
Resolvers allow Spring to automatically detect and call

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.635
the right method in response to one of the GraphQL queries or mutations.

00:00:31.635 --> 00:00:36.079
We wrapped up with learning about a useful tool called GraphiQL that

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.655
allows you to execute queries and mutations against a GraphQL server.

00:00:40.655 --> 00:00:46.469
Next, I will teach you about developing microservices using Spring Boot.
