00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
Hello, I'm Keisha Williams.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.525
Welcome to my course,

00:00:03.524 --> 00:00:05.775
web services and APIs.

00:00:05.775 --> 00:00:10.980
Today I will teach you about GraphQL which is a query language for APIs.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.330
We will start with an overview of GraphQL and the GraphQL schema.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.469
Then, I will show you how to build a GraphQL server that exposes APIs to create,

00:00:21.469 --> 00:00:23.459
read, update, and delete.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.664
I will teach you about resolvers,

00:00:25.664 --> 00:00:29.519
queries, mutators, and how to handle errors.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.905
We will wrap up with GraphQL,

00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:34.740
a web application that allows you to execute

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.280
queries and mutations against a GraphQL server.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.689
So let's get started.
