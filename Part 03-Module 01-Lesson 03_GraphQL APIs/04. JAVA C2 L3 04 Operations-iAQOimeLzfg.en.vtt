00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:09.015
GraphQL offers operations on data like queries and mutations.

00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:14.800
Each query will have a specific object that it returns and based on the object returned,

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.219
you can add or remove fields to match

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:21.210
the exact data you need to fit your specific use case.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.839
GraphQL also has the ability to update the data

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:28.289
stored on the server by the means of mutations.

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.019
Mutations like we saw; create, update,

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.269
or delete will change the data,

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.859
unlike a simple query.
