00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.905
Now that I've started and deployed the GraphQL application to Tomcat,

00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:07.620
let's see the GraphQL server in action.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:15.150
The first step is to navigate to localhost:8080/graphql/schema.json in a web browser.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.399
In this case, I'm using Firefox.

00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:21.000
This shows all of the schemas on the GraphQL server.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.734
Notice, it highlights the queries and the mutations.

00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:26.969
So for the query like we saw before,

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:29.070
we have find all locations.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.109
For the mutations, we have adding a new location,

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:35.314
deleting and existing location,

00:00:35.314 --> 00:00:37.774
and updating the location name.

00:00:37.774 --> 00:00:40.699
Now that the GraphQL server is up and running,

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.100
we have several options for testing.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.175
The first is to use a simple tool like postman.

00:00:46.174 --> 00:00:47.959
So let's navigate there.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.149
To test the GraphQL server,

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.810
simply send a post request to this URL.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.295
Localhost:8080/graphql. For headers, you would set the content type to application.json,

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:03.573
and for the post body,

00:01:03.573 --> 00:01:06.844
you would use query because we're sending a query.

00:01:06.844 --> 00:01:10.215
The name of the query findAllLocations,

00:01:10.215 --> 00:01:13.655
and the fields that you want returned back in your query,

00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:16.174
name, ID, and address.

00:01:16.174 --> 00:01:20.179
Simply click "Send" and notice here it sends back all of

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.275
the locations found in our H2 in memory database.

00:01:24.275 --> 00:01:28.490
There's also another popular way to test GraphQL APIs,

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:31.250
and it is through a tool called Graph EQL.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.659
So let's take a look at it.
