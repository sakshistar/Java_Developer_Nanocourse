00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.279
So what is STOMP?

00:00:02.279 --> 00:00:07.964
STOMP stands for, Simple Text Oriented Message Protocol,

00:00:07.964 --> 00:00:13.094
which is some simple text-based message protocol.

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:20.210
With it, user can send and retrieve message to and fro each other,

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.385
STOMP is called HTTP for web,

00:00:25.385 --> 00:00:33.750
it defines a handful of frame types that are mapped onto websocket frames.

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.960
So here are the STOMP for an object,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.125
so you have command which is a string,

00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:47.579
you have a header which is a JavaScript object,

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.679
and the body is also a string.
