00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.609
Let's walk through to loss approach,

00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:05.699
to handle exceptions in Spring Boot.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.609
In this video, I'm going to show you how to handle

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:12.299
exceptions with Handler Exception Resolver.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.115
As you can see, Handler Exception Resolver

00:00:17.114 --> 00:00:21.375
is very similar to simple Mapping Exception Resolver.

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:24.945
What differences is instead of using a map,

00:00:24.945 --> 00:00:30.660
here we are using reflection to see what kind of

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.899
exception there is and assign them to the view to handle the exception.
