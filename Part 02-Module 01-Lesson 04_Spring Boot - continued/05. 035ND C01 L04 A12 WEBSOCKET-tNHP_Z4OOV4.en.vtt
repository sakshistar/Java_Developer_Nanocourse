00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.724
First of all, we need to define the model and then contest the message

00:00:04.724 --> 00:00:10.425
and message rubber to be passed between client-side and server-side.

00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:16.935
In this example, we're defining the message as a user class,

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:21.494
and we add one attribute name in this class.

00:00:21.495 --> 00:00:30.520
We define the message rubber as user response clause with one attribute content.
