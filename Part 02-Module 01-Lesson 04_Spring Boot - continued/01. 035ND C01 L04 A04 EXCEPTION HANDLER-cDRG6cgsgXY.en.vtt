00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.555
So if you set up correctly on this,

00:00:02.555 --> 00:00:06.005
let's walk through the demo two we have for exceptions.

00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:08.464
What we defined in our controller is,

00:00:08.464 --> 00:00:14.189
we have an add method which will give you the mass exception.

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:18.975
Yes, you can see that you are leading to a numeric overflow exception,

00:00:18.975 --> 00:00:24.885
and we have an update which are leading to a NullPointer exception.

00:00:24.885 --> 00:00:27.045
What we're adding here is,

00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:33.554
we are adding two method and we annotate it with exception handler.

00:00:33.554 --> 00:00:41.159
Each exception handler will take in one exception, let's take look.

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:49.809
Each exception we're leading to a different HTML page.

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:55.959
So to mathError we're leading to that mass exception,

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.234
mathError.html and the nullPointerError we're leading that to the

00:01:02.234 --> 00:01:08.340
nullPointerError.html so that if you have different exceptions,

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.579
you could take the user to a different error page.

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:18.464
Let's take a look. So we're coming here,

00:01:18.465 --> 00:01:20.355
if we use add a number,

00:01:20.355 --> 00:01:26.175
for the ADD, we have a math exception, numeric overflow exception.

00:01:26.174 --> 00:01:31.539
Now let's go to a different view now and I'll try update.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.070
So the update should go to find a NullPointerException.

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:40.679
Now we are going to that view as well.
