00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.975
Here are some steps to implement WebSocket Config.

00:00:03.975 --> 00:00:07.889
First, our config clause need to implement

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:14.740
web socket message broker configure clause to override to default method.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.315
We need to overwrite register assume p endpoints method,

00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:25.440
which is where the WebSocket is created.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.505
We'll create one socket in this example.

00:00:29.504 --> 00:00:34.725
If you want, you can create multiples of WebSockets in this method.

00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:40.395
We need to override configuration message broker to set the broker information.

00:00:40.395 --> 00:00:43.920
In which, we need to add a prefix,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.704
so that the message will go to correct channel.

00:00:47.704 --> 00:00:56.210
A message broker is a computer program that transmit a message for a sender to receiver.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.503
Last, we need to add annotations to tell Spring Boot application,

00:01:01.503 --> 00:01:03.919
this is configuration clause,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.159
and this is a WebSocket Message Broker.
