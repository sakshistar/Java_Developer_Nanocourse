00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.724
Let's take a look at the config file we created for the WebSocket application.

00:00:04.724 --> 00:00:07.184
As you can see in the demo,

00:00:07.184 --> 00:00:11.234
we have created a WebSocketConfig class

00:00:11.234 --> 00:00:16.064
which implements the WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer class,

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:23.109
and override registers stompEndpoints and ConfigureMessageBroker are missing.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:30.150
In this method, we are creating a broker.

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:33.239
So we're defining an endpoint,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.460
and in here, we are saying,

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.875
we are using SockJS.

00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:41.024
In the ConfigMessageBroker method,

00:00:41.024 --> 00:00:48.179
we are enabling this broker and we add a prefix for it.

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:56.575
Then we add an application destination prefix to send the message to the correct channel.

00:00:56.575 --> 00:00:59.325
After we're done with all the class,

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:03.885
we annotate this class with configuration.

00:01:03.884 --> 00:01:05.998
Also with this annotation,

00:01:05.998 --> 00:01:10.140
we enabled the WebSocketMessageBroker.
