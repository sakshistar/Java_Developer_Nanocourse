00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.214
Great. Now you should have your WebSocket application ready.

00:00:04.214 --> 00:00:07.109
Let's run it, shall we?

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.455
So I'm running the WebSocket application here.

00:00:10.455 --> 00:00:13.050
What it can do is, when you connect it to

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.054
the broker and you will see that you can start sending the messages.

00:00:18.054 --> 00:00:22.070
In here, what we are sending is a name.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.460
You can see that the Schedulers keep coming because we

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.140
are trying to putting out auto messages into the broker when it's empty.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.034
So if I say, I'm John and we'll send this message to broker,

00:00:37.034 --> 00:00:41.954
it will display that in the UI. Let's try different.

00:00:41.954 --> 00:00:45.280
Let me start another UI.

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.454
So this is second client,

00:00:49.454 --> 00:00:52.420
which is connected to the broker.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.855
Here with Stephen, I'm sending that,

00:00:57.854 --> 00:00:59.625
and in this here,

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:01.484
you can also see the messages.

00:01:01.484 --> 00:01:05.239
Because remember, we are sending all the messages to

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.140
one broker and all the UI are showing that.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.409
So if I'm doing that here and I'm sending John 2,

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.265
I'm the message, you'll see the message over her,

00:01:19.265 --> 00:01:21.310
and you will see the message over here.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.100
I hope you enjoy this demo.
