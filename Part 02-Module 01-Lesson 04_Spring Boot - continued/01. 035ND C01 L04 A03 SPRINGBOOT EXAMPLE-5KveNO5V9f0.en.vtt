00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.189
Let's walk through a demo one.

00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:04.040
So if you don't have a page,

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.609
this is always a full page.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.199
This is default Spring Boot error page.

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:13.964
As you can see, it doesn't really tell you anything about it.

00:00:13.964 --> 00:00:19.809
Let's see what happen if we enable the error the XML page.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.780
As I can see, we've created

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:44.145
a custom error page for all the exceptions happening in Spring Boot application.

00:00:44.145 --> 00:00:51.815
Let's see what happened. So instead of showing the default Spring Boot error page,

00:00:51.814 --> 00:00:54.949
now we are lending a different error page.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.115
It's the custom page we've created ourselves.

00:00:58.115 --> 00:01:00.690
So if we try something else.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.195
As you can see, all the errors are leading to this page now.

00:01:05.194 --> 00:01:07.399
Is this a good approach?

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.460
Probably, but we should see some other pages.
