00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.165
Let's walk through to user and UserResponse we created as our model.

00:00:06.165 --> 00:00:08.925
So we create a model directory,

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:11.550
where we place two class.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.765
One is user class.

00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:20.100
The user class have one attribute name and another one is UserResponse class.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.515
Remember, this is all our message.

00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:25.455
So user is our message class,

00:00:25.454 --> 00:00:31.239
and UserResponse is our message repre class.
