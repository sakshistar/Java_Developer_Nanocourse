00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
Congratulation. I'm glad you made it so far.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.190
In this course, where I started with some Java refreshment.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.580
With that, if you're coming from a different programming language,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.234
you should be able to pick up Java easily.

00:00:14.234 --> 00:00:16.109
If you're coming from Java,

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.009
you just see if it can solve all the problems in the lesson.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.955
Next we started our Spring Boot introduction.

00:00:23.954 --> 00:00:26.070
With that, you should find yourself

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.984
comfortable to build a Spring Boot application from scratch.

00:00:29.984 --> 00:00:35.984
We covered template engine to show you how to implement Spring Boot views.

00:00:35.984 --> 00:00:40.954
We then covered a particular Spring Boot application web socket.

00:00:40.954 --> 00:00:42.859
If you follow the steps,

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:48.109
you see how a Spring Boot application is designed and implemented.

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:51.484
We have also covered some miscellaneous topics,

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:54.070
like unit tests, validation,

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.655
exception handling, and packaging,

00:00:56.655 --> 00:01:00.689
which are very helpful in your Spring Boot development.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.260
Thanks for tuning in guys.

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:07.649
I hope this course will help you in the future. Good luck.
