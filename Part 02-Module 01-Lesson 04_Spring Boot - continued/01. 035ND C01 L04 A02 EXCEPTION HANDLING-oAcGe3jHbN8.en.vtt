00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.065
There are five ways we can handle Spring Boot exceptions.

00:00:04.065 --> 00:00:08.320
First, we can create a custom error page.

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.679
Second, we can use Exception Handler annotation.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:22.240
Three, we can use Controller Advice and Exception Handler.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.929
Four, we can configure a Simple Mapping Exception Resolver.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.505
Five, we can Custom Handler Exception Resolver class.

00:00:35.505 --> 00:00:40.620
