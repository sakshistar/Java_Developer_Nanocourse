00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.915
Let's walk through to use a controller we created.

00:00:03.915 --> 00:00:06.405
So we created our controller directory,

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:09.089
where we put to use a controller over here.

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:13.169
We annotated this controller annotation.

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:17.144
We'd create a message here called getUser.

00:00:17.144 --> 00:00:19.995
We get user from UI,

00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:25.785
and we wrap it with massive wrapper, UserResponse.

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:30.699
We annotated this method with message mapping,

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.564
which is mapped this message to user.

00:00:34.564 --> 00:00:38.659
We're defining where this message we will be sending to.

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:44.159
So here we are sending this to this broker.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.234
We have created the model and the controller.

00:00:49.234 --> 00:00:56.549
Next, we are going to implement to config file for our web socket application.
