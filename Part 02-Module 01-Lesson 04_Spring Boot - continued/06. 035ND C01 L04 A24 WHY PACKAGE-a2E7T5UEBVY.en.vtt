00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.365
Assume you have no problem running your application locally,

00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:08.370
but our angle is to make this application running

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:12.974
on server so people from different location can use it.

00:00:12.974 --> 00:00:19.869
To achieve that, we need to make sure our application is packaged.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.900
There are two types of packaging strategy.

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.839
We can pack that into a JAR file.

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:33.299
The JAR file contains library's,

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:38.569
resource, and accessories files like property file.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.304
We can also pack that into WAR file.

00:00:42.304 --> 00:00:50.950
The WAR file contains web application that can be deployed on any server or container.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.109
The WAR file contains JSP, HTML, JavaScript,

00:00:55.109 --> 00:01:01.429
and other files necessary for the development of web application.

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:07.750
In this session, we're only going to cover JAR file packaging.
