00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.294
Starting this lesson, we're going to learn WebSocket in Spring Boot.

00:00:05.294 --> 00:00:09.449
We're starting with introduce WebSocket,

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:15.910
then we introduce STOMP, and STOMP commands.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:23.890
We'll then implement Spring Boot WebSocket components in our demo.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.675
So the component incurred WebSocket Config,

00:00:30.675 --> 00:00:36.810
Message, Message Wrapper, Message Controller, and Browser Client.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:44.800
Also, we created a Scheduler for the WebSocket application we created.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:51.350
We are going to explain each WebSocket components we are going to implement,

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.755
and implement them step by step.

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:56.585
So what is WebSocket?

00:00:56.585 --> 00:01:00.454
To make a short, WebSocket is a protocol

00:01:00.454 --> 00:01:06.275
used to transmit real-time messages between client and server.

00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:10.475
Therefore, to implement a WebSocket application,

00:01:10.474 --> 00:01:15.349
we need to have both server side and client side.

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:18.524
In this lesson, I'm going to walk through

00:01:18.525 --> 00:01:23.800
a quick WebSocket implementation using Spring Boot framework.

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:26.399
We'll use a STOMP,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.870
or WebSocket to communicate with each other.
