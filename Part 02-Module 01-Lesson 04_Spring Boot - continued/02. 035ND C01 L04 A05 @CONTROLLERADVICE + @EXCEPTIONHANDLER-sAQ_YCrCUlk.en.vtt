00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.035
In the last video, we learned how to define the exception handlers in the controller.

00:00:07.035 --> 00:00:10.259
But what if we have multiple controllers?

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:12.765
Are we going to duplicate our code and put to

00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:16.019
our controller as a set of exception handlers?

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:20.939
What we can do is, we can use the controller otherwise

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.710
annotation to create a set of global exception handlers.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.950
So when exceptions happens in the controller,

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.259
this will handle the exception.

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:38.204
Let's take a look at the demo we have.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:43.479
As you can see, if we have multiple controllers in our application,

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:46.114
we don't want to duplicate our code.

00:00:46.115 --> 00:00:49.039
So instead, we are creating

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:55.729
global exception handlers to handle all the exceptions in here in one class.

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:01.979
Let's take a look. So the concept is as seen.

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:03.704
So what changes is,

00:01:03.704 --> 00:01:05.564
to award the duplication,

00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:09.079
we create a global exception handler file

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:13.650
to handle all the exceptions in our application.
