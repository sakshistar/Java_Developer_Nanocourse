00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.370
In this session, we have covered WebSocket and STNP.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.330
We have discussed the components,

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.884
we need to implement for a WebSocket obligation,

00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:15.765
and we'll walk through them one by one.

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:17.685
If you're following instruction,

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:21.824
you have your spring put WebSocket application ready.

00:00:21.824 --> 00:00:24.855
As you can see, with Spring put framework,

00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:29.385
we can design and implement a web application easily.

00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:31.560
In the next session,

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:37.914
I'm going to show you how to package this application with Maven plugins,

00:00:37.914 --> 00:00:44.369
so that your application will be production ready. Stay tuned.
