00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
When running the artifact,

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.995
we can also add in flags to change

00:00:04.995 --> 00:00:11.009
the default setting like we did in our application to our properties store file.

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:16.079
Let's try it. So the example I'm doing right now is to

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:21.794
change a server port number to 8090 instead of 8080.

00:00:21.795 --> 00:00:25.320
So it is pretty easy that we're running to

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.269
send snapshot as before and we are adding a flag over here.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.800
We're running the application,

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:40.829
and as you can see that right now,

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.920
the application is running on port 8090 right now.

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:57.019
We could also do to adding to trace to our snapshot.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.425
So instead of adding one flag,

00:01:00.424 --> 00:01:05.819
we can actually add in more flags with the command line.

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:18.605
As you can see, in addition to changing the port number,

00:01:18.605 --> 00:01:23.020
I'm also adding to trace to the application.

00:01:23.019 --> 00:01:25.424
So if you have multiple things,

00:01:25.424 --> 00:01:31.920
you can just add it up to our command line to change to default setting.
