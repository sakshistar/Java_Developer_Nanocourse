00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
Good job. This is the end of this lesson.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.095
We have covered foreign topics in this lesson.

00:00:07.094 --> 00:00:10.695
We have covered Spring Boot exception handling.

00:00:10.695 --> 00:00:14.550
We implement a web socket application.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.875
We packed the application with Maven, a Maven plugin.

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:23.789
With all the knowledge you have acquired so far,

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.739
you should have no problem putting a Spring Boot application from scratch,

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:32.085
funding and adding necessary dependencies,

00:00:32.085 --> 00:00:35.759
adding a unit test, enable swap,

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:39.554
adding validation, handle exceptions,

00:00:39.554 --> 00:00:44.384
and packing the application to be production ready.

00:00:44.384 --> 00:00:53.459
We saw that your application should be robust and stable. Good luck.
