00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.815
Okay. Now you have your snapshot generated.

00:00:04.815 --> 00:00:06.915
Let's see how to run it.

00:00:06.915 --> 00:00:11.969
As you can see that, the snapshot is generated inside the target folder.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.515
So what I can do is,

00:00:13.515 --> 00:00:14.625
if you want to run it,

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:16.394
in intelligence it's really easy,

00:00:16.394 --> 00:00:19.329
you can just run it like this.

00:00:21.469 --> 00:00:24.479
We can also run it with command line.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.379
What we do is,

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:30.179
just go to the target folder and run this command line.

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:38.169
So you can also run it with command line.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.380
What do you do, is just using

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.630
the Java command

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.380
to run it.
