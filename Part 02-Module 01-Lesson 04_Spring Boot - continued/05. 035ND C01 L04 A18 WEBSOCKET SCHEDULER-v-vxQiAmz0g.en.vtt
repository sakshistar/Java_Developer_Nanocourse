00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.214
In this example, we're adding a scheduler to push messages to the broker.

00:00:07.214 --> 00:00:15.660
First, we'll create a simple messaging template to convert messages and send to broker.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.390
We annotate a method with scheduled annotation to define the time delay.

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:28.779
We annotate a class with configuration and enable scheduling.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.509
Let's take a look a scheduled clause recruited in this example.

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:43.809
As you can see, we've created a schedule config class inside of config directory,

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:51.560
where we have simple messaging template for converting and sending messages to broker.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.150
We annotate this clause with configuration,

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.530
and we annotate this clause with enable scheduling.
