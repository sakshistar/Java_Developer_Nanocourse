Now that we have everything ready but the view,

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.550
we're going to create a simple UI with options to connect,

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:16.260
disconnect from WebSocket, and we'll use that to send messages to the broker.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.850
We'll need a message input and send button to send the message. What's a WebSocket?

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.835
A connected user can send messages to whoever joined.

00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:33.789
Without further delay, let's get started.
