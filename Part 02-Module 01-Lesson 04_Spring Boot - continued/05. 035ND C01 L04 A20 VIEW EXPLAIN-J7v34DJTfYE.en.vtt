00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.464
In this example, I'm

00:00:03.464 --> 00:00:13.455
using some party libraries.

00:00:13.455 --> 00:00:18.164
So we're using Bootstrap to making sure that our style looks good,

00:00:18.164 --> 00:00:21.195
we're using the jQuery.

00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:28.269
We're using sockJS and S2MPJS to handle the messages.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.049
A you can see that in our JavaScript in the view,

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:38.609
we have connect, disconnect, send message.

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:45.820
So we're using all of this to send message from a UI to the controller,

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.930
and the rest of those are just HTML's that we

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:56.909
use to get user input and render the message.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.919
To use all the third party libraries,

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:08.790
I'm adding few dependencies over here,

00:01:10.129 --> 00:01:15.039
and you can use them as well in your example.
